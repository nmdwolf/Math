We review progress towards a definition of n‐category suited for this purpose, and outline a program in which n‐dimensional topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) are to be described as n‐category representations. First we describe a ‘‘suspension’’ operation on n‐categories, and hypothesize that the k‐fold suspension of a weak n‐category stabilizes for k≥n+2. We give evidence for this hypothesis and describe its relation to stable homotopy theory. We then propose a description of n‐dimensional unitary extended TQFTs as weak n‐functors from the ‘‘free stable weak n‐category with duals on one object’’ to the n‐category of ‘‘n‐Hilbert spaces.’’ We conclude by describing n‐categorical generalizations of deformation quantization and the quantum double construction.},

	abstract = {A new type of algebra for Minkowski space‐time is described, in terms of which it is possible to express any conformally covariant or Poincaré covariant operation. The elements of the algebra (twistors) are combined according to tensor‐type rules, but they differ from tensors or spinors in that they describe locational properties in addition to directional ones. The representation of a null line by a pair of two‐component spinors, one of which defines the direction of the line and the other, its moment about the origin, gives the simplest type of twistor, with four complex components. The rules for generating other types of twistor are then determined by the geometry. One‐index twistors define a four‐dimensional, four‐valued (``spinor'') representation of the (restricted) conformal group. For the Poincaré group a skew‐symmetric metric twistor is introduced. Twistor space defines a complex projective three‐space C, which gives an alternative picture equivalent to the Minkowski space‐time M (which must be completed by a null cone at infinity). Points in C represent null lines or ``complexified'' null lines in M; lines in C represent real or complex points in M (so M, when complexified, is the Klein representation of C. Conformal transformations of M, including space and time reversals (and complex conjugation) are discussed in detail in twistor terms. A theorem of Kerr is described which shows that the complex analytic surfaces in C define the shear‐free null congruences in the real space M. Twistors are used to derive new theorems about the real geometry of M. The general twistor description of physical fields is left to a later paper.},

	abstract = {The covariant phase space method of Iyer, Lee, Wald, and Zoupas gives an elegant way to understand the Hamiltonian dynamics of Lagrangian field theories without breaking covariance. The original literature however does not systematically treat total derivatives and boundary terms, which has led to some confusion about how exactly to apply the formalism in the presence of boundaries. In particular the original construction of the canonical Hamiltonian relies on the assumed existence of a certain boundary quantity "\$B\$", whose physical interpretation has not been clear. We here give an algorithmic procedure for applying the covariant phase space formalism to field theories with spatial boundaries, from which the term in the Hamiltonian involving \$B\$ emerges naturally. Our procedure also produces an additional boundary term, which was not present in the original literature and which so far has only appeared implicitly in specific examples, and which is already nonvanishing even in general relativity with sufficiently permissive boundary conditions. The only requirement we impose is that at solutions of the equations of motion the action is stationary modulo future/past boundary terms under arbitrary variations obeying the spatial boundary conditions; from this the symplectic structure and the Hamiltonian for any diffeomorphism that preserves the theory are unambiguously constructed. We show in examples that the Hamiltonian so constructed agrees with previous results. We also show that the Poisson bracket on covariant phase space directly coincides with the Peierls bracket, without any need for non-covariant intermediate steps, and we discuss possible implications for the entropy of dynamical black hole horizons.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.hep-th/9712157},
	abstract = {This is a survey of `Cohomological Physics', a phrase that first appeared in the context of anomalies in gauge theory. Differential forms were implicit in physics at least as far back as Gauss (1833) (cf. his electro-magnetic definition of the linking number), and more visibly in Dirac's magnetic monopole (1931). The magnetic charge was given by the first Chern number. Thus were characteristic classes (and by implication the cohomology of Lie algebras and of Lie groups) introduced into physics. The `ghosts' introduced by Fade'ev and Popov were incorporated into what came to be known as BRST cohomology. Later the ghosts were reinterpreted as generators of the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex for Lie algebra cohomology. Cohomological physics also makes use of group theoretic cohomology, algebraic deformation theory and especially a novel extension of homological algebra, combining Lie algebra cohomology with the Koszul-Tate resolution, the major emphasis of the talk. This synergistic combination of both kinds of cohomology appeared in the Batalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky approach to the cohomological reduction of constrained Poisson algebras. An analogous `odd' version was developed in the Batalin-Vilkovisky approach to quantizing particle Lagrangians and Lagrangians of string field theory. A revisionist view of the Batalin- Vilkovisky machinery recognizes parts of it as a reconstruction of homological algebra with some powerful new ideas undreamt of in that discipline.},

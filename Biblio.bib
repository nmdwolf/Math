The {\textbackslash}texttt\{crepes\} package implements standard, normalized and Mondrian conformal regressors and predictive systems, and is completely model-agnostic, using only the residuals for the calibration instances, possibly together with difficulty estimates and Mondrian categories as input, when forming the conformal regressors and predictive systems. This allows the user to easily incorporate and evaluate novel difficulty estimates and ways of forming Mondrian categories, as well as combinations thereof. Examples from using the package are given, illustrating how to incorporate some standard options for difficulty estimation, forming Mondrian categories and the use of out-of-bag predictions for calibration, through helper functions defined in a separate module, called {\textbackslash}texttt\{crepes.fillings\}. The relation to other software packages for conformal regression is also pointed out.},

An old result by Ruschendorf and, independently, Meng implies that the p-values can be combined by scaling up their arithmetic mean by a factor of 2 (and no smaller factor is sufficient in general). Based on more recent developments in mathematical finance, specifically, robust risk aggregation techniques, we show that K p-values can be combined by scaling up their geometric mean by a factor of e (for all K) and by scaling up their harmonic mean by a factor of ln K (asymptotically as K -{\textgreater} infinity). These and other results lead to a generalized version of the Bonferroni-Holm method. A simulation study compares the performance of various averaging methods.},

A common example is a-priori knowledge given by a distance measure between objects. A simple but effective approach for kernel construction consists of substituting the Euclidean distance in ordinary kernel functions by the problem speciﬁc distance measure. We formalize this distance substitution procedure and investigate theoretical and empirical effects. In particular we state criteria for deﬁniteness of the resulting kernels. We demonstrate the wide applicability by solving several classiﬁcation tasks with SVMs. Regularization of the kernel matrices can additionally increase the recognition accuracy.},

It arises in several interesting industrial and environmental application domains, such as ecological modelling and energy forecasting. This paper presents an ensemble method for multi-target regression that constructs new target variables via random linear combinations of existing targets. We discuss the connection of our approach with multi-label classification algorithms, in particular RAkEL, which originally inspired this work, and a family of recent multi-label classification algorithms that involve output coding. Experimental results on 12 multi-target datasets show that it performs significantly better than a strong baseline that learns a single model for each target using gradient boosting and compares favourably to multi-objective random forest approach, which is a state-of-the-art approach. The experiments further show that our approach improves more when stronger unconditional dependencies exist among the targets.},

The question is how to take advantage of correlations between the response variables to improve predictive accuracy compared with the usual procedure of doing individual regressions of each response variable on the common set of predictor variables. A new procedure is introduced called the curds and whey method. Its use can substantially reduce prediction errors when there are correlations between responses while maintaining accuracy even if the responses are uncorrelated. In extensive simulations, the new procedure is compared with several previously proposed methods for predicting multiple responses (including partial least squares) and exhibits superior accuracy. One version can be easily implemented in the context of standard statistical packages.},

It does this by learning tasks in parallel while using a shared representation; what is learned for each task can help other tasks be learned better. This paper reviews prior work on MTL, presents new evidence that MTL in backprop nets discovers task relatedness without the need of supervisory signals, and presents new results for MTL with k-nearest neighbor and kernel regression. In this paper we demonstrate multitask learning in three domains. We explain how multitask learning works, and show that there are many opportunities for multitask learning in real domains. We present an algorithm and results for multitask learning with case-based methods like k-nearest neighbor and kernel regression, and sketch an algorithm for multitask learning in decision trees. Because multitask learning works, can be applied to many different kinds of domains, and can be used with different learning algorithms, we conjecture there will be many opportunities for its use on real-world problems.},

	abstract = {The use of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) applications in medicine has attracted a great deal of attention in the medical literature, but little is known about how to use Conformal Predictions (CP) to assess the accuracy of individual predictions in clinical applications. We performed a comprehensive search in SCOPUS® to find papers reporting the use of CP in clinical applications. We identified 14 papers reporting the use of CP for clinical applications, and we briefly describe the methods and results reported in these papers. The literature reviewed shows that CP methods can be used in clinical applications to provide important insight into the accuracy of individual predictions. Unfortunately, the review also shows that most of the studies have been performed in isolation, without input from practicing clinicians, not providing comparisons among different approaches and not considering important socio-technical considerations leading to clinical adoption.},

	abstract = {The study of topological quantum field theories increasingly relies upon concepts from higher‐dimensional algebra such as n‐categories and n‐vector spaces. We review progress towards a definition of n‐category suited for this purpose, and outline a program in which n‐dimensional topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) are to be described as n‐category representations. First we describe a ‘‘suspension’’ operation on n‐categories, and hypothesize that the k‐fold suspension of a weak n‐category stabilizes for k≥n+2. We give evidence for this hypothesis and describe its relation to stable homotopy theory. We then propose a description of n‐dimensional unitary extended TQFTs as weak n‐functors from the ‘‘free stable weak n‐category with duals on one object’’ to the n‐category of ‘‘n‐Hilbert spaces.’’ We conclude by describing n‐categorical generalizations of deformation quantization and the quantum double construction.},

	doi = {10.1063/1.1705200},
	abstract = {A new type of algebra for Minkowski space‐time is described, in terms of which it is possible to express any conformally covariant or Poincaré covariant operation. The elements of the algebra (twistors) are combined according to tensor‐type rules, but they differ from tensors or spinors in that they describe locational properties in addition to directional ones. The representation of a null line by a pair of two‐component spinors, one of which defines the direction of the line and the other, its moment about the origin, gives the simplest type of twistor, with four complex components. The rules for generating other types of twistor are then determined by the geometry. One‐index twistors define a four‐dimensional, four‐valued (``spinor'') representation of the (restricted) conformal group. For the Poincaré group a skew‐symmetric metric twistor is introduced. Twistor space defines a complex projective three‐space C, which gives an alternative picture equivalent to the Minkowski space‐time M (which must be completed by a null cone at infinity). Points in C represent null lines or ``complexified'' null lines in M; lines in C represent real or complex points in M (so M, when complexified, is the Klein representation of C. Conformal transformations of M, including space and time reversals (and complex conjugation) are discussed in detail in twistor terms. A theorem of Kerr is described which shows that the complex analytic surfaces in C define the shear‐free null congruences in the real space M. Twistors are used to derive new theorems about the real geometry of M. The general twistor description of physical fields is left to a later paper.},

\section{Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral}

    Aside from the Lebesgue measure one can construct some other important measures (and their associated integrals) on the Borel $\sigma$-algebra of the real line $\mathbb{R}$. These constructions will be important in the study of density functions in probability theory. To this end consider a function $F$ that is right-continuous, i.e. $F(x^+)=F(x)$, and monotonically increasing. The length of an interval can be generalized in the following way:
    \newdef{$F$-length}{\index{length}
        The $F$-length of an interval $]a,b]$ is defined as follows:
        \begin{gather}
            l_F\big(]a,b]\big) := F(b) - F(a).
        \end{gather}
        The restriction to half-open intervals assures that this function is additive when taking unions of intervals. The footnote in Definition \ref{topology:borel_set} also assures that the $\sigma$-algebra generated by these intervals is the Borel $\sigma$-algebra on $\mathbb{R}$.
    }

    An immediate extension of Definition \ref{lebesgue:outer_measure} gives the outer measure associated to $F$:
    \newdef{$F$-outer measure}{\index{outer!measure}\label{lebesgue:lebesgue_stieltjes_measure}
        Let $X\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ be a set. The $F$-outer measure of $X$ is defined as follows:
        \begin{gather}
            \mu_F^*(X) := \inf\left\{\sum_{n=1}^\infty l_F(I_n)\,\middle\vert\,\seq{I}\text{ a sequence of half-open intervals that cover }X\right\}.
        \end{gather}
    }
    Using this outer measure one can define the $\mu_F$-measurable sets as those sets satisfying Carath\'eodory's criterion (with respect to $\mu_F^*$). The main difference with the Lebesgue measure is that $\mu_F$ is not necessarily translation-invariant and that singletons are not necessarily null:
    \begin{property}[Singletons]\index{atom}
        The $F$-measure of a singleton $\{x\}$ is equal to the jump of $F$ at $x$:
        \begin{gather}
            \mu_F\big(\{x\}\big) = F(x) - F(x^-).
        \end{gather}
        Such elements are examples of \textbf{atoms}, sets of positive measure for which every proper measurable subset is null.
    \end{property}
    \begin{result}
        It follows that the Lebesgue-Stieltjes measures having null singletons are exactly those for which $F$ is continuous.
    \end{result}

    \begin{property}[Regularity]\index{Borel!measure}
        The Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure is a regular Borel measure. Furthermore, every (finite) regular Borel measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb{R}$ is equal to a Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure induced by the function
        \begin{gather}
            F(x) = \mu\big(]-\!\infty,x]\big).
        \end{gather}
    \end{property}

    \begin{example}[Lebesgue measure]\index{Lebesgue!measure}
        The Lebesgue measure is the Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure associated to $F(x)=x$.
    \end{example}
    \begin{example}[Dirac measure]\index{Dirac!measure}
        The Dirac measure at $x\in\mathbb{R}$ can be obtained as the Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure for $F(x)=\mathbbm{1}_{[x,\infty[}$.
    \end{example}

\subsection{Signed measures}

    \newdef{Signed measure}{\index{measure!signed}
        Consider a measurable space $(X,\Sigma)$. A function $\mu:\Sigma\rightarrow\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ is called a signed measure if it satisfies the following conditions:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item\textbf{Measure zero}: $\mu(\emptyset) = 0$, and
            \item\textbf{Countable additivity} : $\forall i\neq j:E_i\cap E_j=\emptyset\implies\mu\left(\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty E_n\right) = \sum_{i=n}^\infty\mu(E_n)$.
        \end{enumerate}
        Note that these requirements are the same as for an ordinary measure \ref{lebesgue:measure}, except that now the function is allowed to become negative. The function is, however, not allowed to attain $-\infty$ to exclude undefined expressions such as $\infty-\infty$.
    }
    \begin{remark}
        An important consequence of this generalization is that signed measures are not necessarily monotonic, i.e. $A\subseteq B\slashed{\implies}\mu(A)\leq\mu(B)$. In fact this is a strict relation. A signed measure is monotonic if and only if it is a genuine measure.
    \end{remark}

    \newdef{Total variation}{\index{variation}
        Consider a signed measure $\mu$ on a measurable space $(X,\Sigma)$. The total variation $|\mu|$ is the measure defined as follows:
        \begin{gather}
            |\mu|(A) := \sup\left\{\sum_{P\in\mathcal{P}}|\mu(P)|\,\middle\vert\,\mathcal{P}\subset\Sigma,\mathcal{P}\text{ covers }A\right\}.
        \end{gather}
        Using this measure one can decompose the signed measure $\mu$ as a difference of two genuine measures:
        \begin{align}
            \mu &= \mu^+-\mu^-\nonumber\\
            &= \frac{1}{2}(|\mu|+\mu)+\frac{1}{2}(|\mu|-\mu).
        \end{align}
        Furthermore, this decomposition is minimal in the sense that if $\mu=\lambda_1-\lambda_2$ for any two measures, then $\mu^+\leq\lambda_1$ and $\mu^-\leq\lambda_2$.
    }

    The following theorem generalizes both the Radon-Nikodym and Lebesgue decomposition theorems to the case of signed measures:
    \begin{theorem}\index{Radon-Nikodym}\label{lebesgue:signed_radon_nikodym}
        Consider a $\sigma$-finite signed measure $\mu$ and a $\sigma$-finite measure $\nu$ on a measurable space $(X,\Sigma)$. There exists a $\nu$-a.e. unique integrable function $f\in L^1(\nu)$ and a $\sigma$-finite measure $\mu_s\perp\nu$ such that for all $A\in\Sigma$:
        \begin{gather}
            \mu(A) = \int_Afd\nu + \mu_s(A).
        \end{gather}
        \emph{As before, the function is called $f$ the Radon-Nikodym derivative of $\mu$.}
    \end{theorem}

    \begin{theorem}[Hahn-Jordan]\index{Hahn-Jordan}
        Consider a signed measure $\mu$ on a measurable space $(X,\Sigma)$. There exists a set $A\in\Sigma$ such that the minimal decomposition $\mu=\mu^+-\mu^-$ in terms of two measures $\mu^\pm$ is given by
        \begin{gather}
            \mu^+(B) = \mu(A\cap B)\qquad\qquad\mu^-(B)=\mu(A^c\cap B).
        \end{gather}
    \end{theorem}

    \newdef{Integral with respect to a signed measure}{\index{integral!signed measure}
        Let $\mu$ be a signed measure on a measurable space $(X,\Sigma)$ and consider a measurable function $f$ on $A\in\Sigma$. The integral of $f$ with respect to $\mu$ is defined as follows:
        \begin{gather}
            \int_Af\,d\mu := \int_Af\,d\mu^+ - \int_Af\,d\mu^-.
        \end{gather}
    }

    \newdef{Lebesgue-Stieltjes signed measure}{
        Let $F$ be a function of bounded variation. According to Property \ref{calculus:bounded_variation_decomposition} it can be written as $F=F_1-F_2$, where $F_1,F_2$ are monotonically increasing, absolutely continuous functions. The Lebesgue-Stieltjes (signed) measure associated to $F$ is defined as $\mu_F := \mu_{F_1}-\mu_{F_2}$.
    }

    \begin{theorem}[Fundamental theorem of calculus]\index{fundamental theorem!of calculus}
        Let $F$ be an absolutely continuous function on the closed interval $[a,b]$. Then $F$ is differentiable $\lambda$-a.e. ($\lambda$ being the Lebesgue measure) and its associated Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure $\mu_F$ has Radon-Nikodym derivative $\deriv{\mu_F}{\lambda}=F'$ $\lambda$-a.e. Furthermore, for all $x\in[a,b]$ one has
        \begin{gather}
            F(x) - F(a) = \mu_F([a,x]) = \int_a^xF'(t)dt.
        \end{gather}
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{result}
        If $F$ is absolutely continuous and $F'=0$ $\lambda$-a.e., then $F$ is constant.
    \end{result}

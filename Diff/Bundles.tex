\chapter{Fibre Bundles}\label{chapter:bundles}

    This chapter is formulated in sufficient generality so as to encompass both the topological and smooth setting (or any other one might find useful). To this end the generic terms ''space'', ''group'' and ''morphism'' are used. The reader should choose in which category he wants to work, e.g. topological space, topological group and continuous map in the case of $\mathbf{Top}$.

\section{General bundles}

    \newdef{Bundle}{\index{bundle}\label{diff:bundle}
        A triple $(E,B,\pi)$ where $E$ and $B$ are spaces and $\pi$ is a morphism. Sometimes one requires that the map $\pi$ is also surjective. However, under this additional restriction one cannot make the association $\mathbf{Bundle}(X)\cong\mathbf{C}/X$ of categories anymore.
    }

    An explicit example in the category $\mathbf{Diff}$ is the following:
    \begin{example}[Fibred manifold]\index{fibred!manifold}\index{fibre}
        A surjective submersion \ref{diff:submersion} \[\pi:E\rightarrow B\] where $E$ is called the \textbf{total space}, $B$ the \textbf{base space} and $\pi$ the \textbf{projection}. For every point $p\in B$, the set $\pi^{-1}(p)$ is called the \textbf{fibre over $p$}.
    \end{example}

    The most important example of a bundle is a fibre bundle. Before being able to give the definition, an important tool needs to be introduced:
    \newdef{Cocycle}{\index{co-!cycle}\label{diff:G_cocycle}
        Let $B$ be a space and $G$ a group. A $G$-valued cocycle on $B$ with respect to an open cover $\{U_i\}_{i\in I}$ is a family of morphisms $g_{ij}:U_i\cap U_j\rightarrow G$ that satisfy the following condition (it is called the \textbf{\v{C}ech cocycle condition}):
        \begin{gather}
            \label{diff:G_cocycle_condition}
            g_{ij} = g_{ik}\circ g_{kj}.
        \end{gather}
        Two cocycles $(U_i, g_{ij})$ and $(V_i, h_{ij})$ are said to be equivalent if there exist morphisms $\lambda_{i,j}:U_i\cap V_j\rightarrow G$ such that
        \begin{gather}
            \lambda_{i,r}g_{ij}\lambda_{j,s}^{-1} = h_{rs}
        \end{gather}
        whenever this is well-defined. The resulting quotient set is denoted by $H^1(B; G)$.\footnote{The notation stems from the fact that this is the first \v{C}ech cohomology group with values in $G$ (see section \ref{section:cech_de_rham}).}
    }
    \begin{property}\label{diff:G_cocycle_conditions}
        Let $\{g_{ij}\}_{i,j\in I}$ be a cocycle on $B$. It satisfies the following properties for all $x\in B$:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $g_{ij}(x) = (g_{ji}(x))^{-1}$, and
            \item $g_{ii}(x) = e$.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{property}

    \newdef{Fibre bundle}{\index{fibre!bundle}\index{local!trivialization}\index{structure!group}
        \label{diff:fibre_bundle}
        A tuple $(E,B,\pi,F,G)$ where $E,B$ and $F$ are spaces and $G$ is a group (called the \textbf{structure group}), such that there exists a surjective morphism \[\pi:E\rightarrow B\] and an open cover $\{U_i\}_{i\in I}$ of $B$ together with a family of isomorphisms $\{\varphi_i:\pi^{-1}(U_i)\rightarrow U_i\times F\}_{i\in I}$ that make the following diagram commute for all $i\in I$:

        \begin{figure}[ht!]
            \centering
            \begin{tikzpicture}
                \node (PI) at (-2, 0) {$\pi^{-1}(U_i)$};
                \node (UF) at (2, 0) {$U_i\times F$};
                \node (U) at (0, -2) {$U_i$};
                \draw[->] (PI) -- node[above]{$\varphi_i$} (UF);
                \draw[->] (PI) -- node[below left]{$\pi$} (U);
                \draw[->] (UF) -- node[below right]{$\text{pr}_1$} (U);
            \end{tikzpicture}
        \end{figure}
        As for general bundles one calls $E$ and $B$ the \textbf{total space} and \textbf{base space} respectively. The space $F$ is called the \textbf{(typical) fibre}. The pair $(U_i,\varphi_i)$ is sometimes called a \textbf{bundle chart} and the set $\{(U_i,\varphi_i)\}_{i\in I}$ is often called a \textbf{local trivialization}\footnote{This name follows from the fact that the bundle is locally isomorphic to a (trivial) product space: $E\cong U\times F$.}. The cover $\{U_i\}_{i\in I}$ itself is called a \textbf{trivializing cover} of the bundle.

        The \textbf{transition maps} $\varphi_j\circ\varphi_i^{-1}:(U_i\cap U_j)\times F\rightarrow (U_i\cap U_j)\times F$ can be identified with the cocycle $g_{ji}:U_i\cap U_j\rightarrow G$, associated to the (left) action (which is required to be faithful\footnote{See definition \ref{group:faithful_action}.}) of $G$ on every fibre, by the following relation:
        \begin{gather}
            \varphi_j\circ\varphi_i^{-1}(b, x) = (b, g_{ji}(b)\cdot x).
        \end{gather}
    }
    \begin{remark}
        One should pay attention to the fact that the bundle charts are not coordinate charts in the sense of manifolds \ref{diff:chart} because the image of $\varphi_i$ is not an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$. However, they serve the same purpose as they are used to locally describe the total space $P$.
    \end{remark}
    \begin{notation}
        A fibre bundle $(E,B,\pi,F,G)$ is often denoted by $F\hookrightarrow E\xrightarrow{\ \pi\ }{B}$ or even $\pi:E\rightarrow B$ if the fibre is not important. A drawback of such notations is that the structure group of the bundle is not shown.
    \end{notation}

    \newdef{Numerable fibre bundle}{\index{numerable}\label{diff:numerable_bundle}
        A fibre bundle that admits a local trivialization over a numerable open cover.
    }

    \newdef{Compatible\footnotemark\ bundle charts}{\index{compatible!bundle charts}
        \footnotetext{Also called an \textbf{admissible chart}.}
        A bundle chart $(V,\psi)$ is said to be compatible with a trivializing cover $\{(U_i, \varphi_i)\}_{i\in I}$ if whenever $V\cap U_i\neq\emptyset$, there exists a map $h_i:V\cap U_i\rightarrow G$ such that
        \begin{gather}
            \psi\circ\varphi_i^{-1}(b,x) = (b,h_i(b)x)
        \end{gather}
        for all $b\in V\cap U_i$ and $x\in F$. Two trivializing covers are said to be equivalent if all bundle charts are cross-compatible. As in the case of manifolds, this gives rise to the notion of a \textbf{$G$-atlas}. A \textbf{$G$-bundle} is then defined as a fibre bundle eqipped with an equivalence class of $G$-atlases.
    }

\subsection{Bundle maps}

    \newdef{Bundle map}{\index{bundle!map}
        A bundle map between two fibre bundles $\pi_1:E_1\rightarrow B_1$ and $\pi_2:E_2\rightarrow B_2$ is a pair $(f_E,f_B)$ of morphisms that make diagram \ref{fig:bundle_map} commute. The map $f_E$ is said to \textbf{cover} $f_B$. If such a couple exists, the base map $f_B$ is uniquely determined by $f_E$ and therefore a bundle map is often just denoted by $f_E:E_1\rightarrow E_2$.

        \begin{figure}[ht!]
        \centering
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \node (E1) at (0, 0) {$E_1$};
            \node (E2) at (2, 0) {$E_2$};
            \node (B1) at (0, -2) {$B_1$};
            \node (B2) at (2, -2) {$B_2$};
            \draw[->] (E1) -- node[above]{$f_E$} (E2);
            \draw[->] (E1) -- node[left]{$\pi_1$} (B1);
            \draw[->] (E2) -- node[right]{$\pi_2$} (B2);
            \draw[->] (B1) -- node[below]{$f_B$} (B2);
        \end{tikzpicture}
        \caption{Bundle map between fibre bundles.}
        \label{fig:bundle_map}
        \end{figure}
    }
    \newdef{Isomorphism}{
        Two fibre bundles $F$ and $G$ are said to be isomorphic if there exist bundle maps $f:F\rightarrow G$ and $g:G\rightarrow F$ such that $f\circ g = \mathbbm{1}_G$ and $g\circ f = \mathbbm{1}_F$.
    }

    \newdef{Equivalent fibre bundles}{\index{gauge!transformation}
        Two fibre bundles $\pi_1:E_1\rightarrow B$ and $\pi_2:E_2\rightarrow B$, with the same typical fibre and structure group, are said to be equivalent if there exist trivializations\footnote{Remark that the collection $\{U_i\}_{i\in I}$ is the same for both trivializations.} $\{(U_i, \varphi_i)\}_{i\in I}$ and $\{(U_i, \varphi'_i)\}_{i\in I}$ such that the associated cocycles are equivalent. An explicit form of the functions $\lambda$ is given by
        \begin{gather}
            \lambda_{i,i} := \varphi_i'\circ\varphi_i^{-1}.
        \end{gather}
    }
    \begin{property}
        Two fibre bundles over the same base space are equivalent if and only if they are isomorphic.
    \end{property}

    \newdef{Trivial bundle}{\index{trivial}\label{diff:trivial_bundle}
        A fibre bundle $(E, B, \pi, F)$ is said to be trivial if there exists an equivalence $E\cong B\times F$.
    }

\subsection{Constructions}

    \begin{construct}[Fibre bundle construction theorem]\label{diff:fibre_bundle_construction_theorem}
        Let $M$ and $F$ be spaces and let $G$ be a group equipped with a left action on $F$. Suppose that a cover $\{U_i\}_{i\in I}$ of $M$ and a collection of morphisms $\{g_{ji}:U_i\cap U_j\rightarrow G\}$ that satisfy the cocycle condition \ref{diff:G_cocycle} are given. A fibre bundle over $M$ can then be constructed as follows:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item First construct for every set $U_i$ an associated set $U_i\times F$.
            \item Then construct the disjoint union $T:=\bigsqcup_{i\in I}U_i\times F$ and equip it with the disjoint union topology (see definition \ref{topology:disjoint_union}).
            \item From this disjoint union construct a quotient space and equip it with the quotient space topology (see definition \ref{topology:quotient_space}) induced by the following equivalence relation for every $i,j\in I$:
                \begin{gather}
                    (p, f)\sim(p,g_{ji}(x)\cdot f)
                \end{gather}
                for all $x\in U_i\cap U_j$ and $f\in F$.
            \item The fibre bundle is equal to the quotient space $T/\sim$ equipped with the projection $\pi$ that maps the equivalence class $(x,f)\in T$ to $x\in M$.
            \item Local trivializations are given by the maps $\varphi_i:\pi^{-1}(U_i)\rightarrow U_i\times F$ that satisfy
                \begin{gather}
                    \varphi_i^{-1}:(x,f)\mapsto [(x,f)]
                \end{gather}
                where $[A]$ denotes the equivalence class of $A$ in $T/\sim$.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{construct}
    \begin{property}[Homotopy invariance]
        Homotopic transition functions give rise to equivalent (and hence isomorphic) bundles. (This follows from the homotopy invariance of \v{C}ech cohomology.)
    \end{property}

    \begin{remark}[Clutching]\index{clutching}
        The above construction is often called the clutching construction, especially when constructing vector bundles over a sphere $S^n$. There the covering consists of two hemispheres that intersect on the equator $S^{n-1}$ and the function $g_{21}$ is in that case also called the \textbf{clutching function}.
    \end{remark}
    \begin{property}[Vector bundles over a sphere]\index{vector!bundle}\label{diff:vector_bundles_over_sphere}
        The clutching theorem and the homotopy invariance imply that vector bundles over the sphere are determined by homotopy classes of functions $S^{n-1}\rightarrow\text{GL}_p(k)$, i.e. they are classified by the homotopy group $\pi_{n-1}(\text{GL}_p(k))$.
    \end{property}

    \newdef{Subbundle}{\index{sub!bundle}
        A subbundle of a fibre bundle $\pi:E\rightarrow B$ is a triple $(E',B',\pi')$ such that $E'\subset E$, $B'\subset B$ and $\pi' = \pi|_{E'}$.
    }
    \newdef{Pullback bundle}{\index{pullback!bundle}\label{diff:pullback_bundle}
        Let $\pi:E\rightarrow B$ be a fibre bundle and let $f:B'\rightarrow B$ be a morphism of spaces. The total space of the pullback bundle $f^*E$ is defined as follows:
        \begin{gather}
            f^*E := \big\{(b',e)\in B'\times E:f(b') = \pi(e)\big\}.
        \end{gather}
        The topology on $f^*E$ is induced by the subspace topology of the product $B'\times E$. The projection onto the second factor gives a map of total spaces $f^*E\rightarrow E$.
    }

    \newdef{Fibre product}{\index{fibre!product}
        Let $(F_1,B,\pi_1)$ and $(F_2,B,\pi_2)$  be two fibre bundles over the same base space $B$. Their fibre product is defined as follows:
        \begin{gather}
            \label{diff:fibre_product}
            F_1\diamond F_2 := \big\{(f, g)\in F_1\times F_2: \pi_1(f) = \pi_2(g)\big\}.
        \end{gather}
    }

\subsection{Sections}

    \newdef{Section}{\index{section}
        A (\textbf{global}) section of a fibre bundle $\pi:E\rightarrow B$ is a morphism $s:B\rightarrow E$ such that $\pi\circ s = \mathbbm{1}_B$. For any open subset $U\subset B$ a \textbf{local} section is defined as a morphism $s_U:U\rightarrow E$ such that $\pi\circ s_U(b) = b$ for all $b\in U$.
    }
    \begin{notation}
        \nomenclature[O_Gamma]{$\Gamma(E)$}{set of global sections of a fibre bundle $E$}
        The set of all global sections of a bundle $E$ is denoted by $\Gamma(E)$. The set of local sections over $U$ is sometimes denoted by $\Gamma(U, E)$. With this latter notation one also has $\Gamma(E)\equiv\Gamma(B, E)$.
    \end{notation}

    \begin{property}[Pullback of sections]
        The sections of a fibre bundle $E$ pullback to the pullback bundle $f^*E$ by setting $f^*s := s\circ f$.
    \end{property}

\chapter{Principal Bundles}\label{chapter:principal_bundles}

    The main reference for this chapter is \cite{principal_bundles}. The theory of principal bundles uses the language of (Lie) group theory quite heavily. For all things related to group theory the reader is referred to sections \ref{section:groups} and \ref{section:group_actions}. For more information on Lie groups and their associated Lie algebras the reader is referred to chapter \ref{chapter:lie}.

\section{Principal bundles}

    \begin{definition}[Principal bundle]\index{principal!bundle}
        A principal bundle is a (smooth) fibre bundle $\pi:P\rightarrow M$ equipped with a right action $\rho:P\times G\rightarrow P$ that satisfies two properties:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Free action}: $\rho$ is free. This implies that the orbits are isomorphic to the structure group.
            \item \textbf{Fibrewise transitivity}: The action preserves fibres, i.e. $y\cdot g\in F_b$ for all $y\in F_b, g\in G$. In turn this implies that the fibres over $M$ are exactly the orbits of $\rho$.
        \end{enumerate}
        Together these properties imply that the typical fibre $F$ and structure group $G$ can be identified. The right action of $G$ on $P$ will often be denoted by $R_g$ (unless this would give conflicts with the same notation for the action of $G$ on itself).
    \end{definition}
    \begin{remark}[$G$-torsor]\index{torsor}\label{diff:fibre_torsor}
        Although the fibres are homeomorphic to $G$, they do not carry a group structure due to the lack of a distinct identity element. This turns them into $G$-torsors. However, it is possible to locally (i.e. in a neighbourhood of a point $p\in M$) endow the fibres with a group structure by choosing an element of every fibre to be the identity element.
    \end{remark}
    \begin{property}
        A corollary of the definition is that the bundle $\pi:P\rightarrow M$ is isomorphic to the bundle $\xi:E\rightarrow E/G$ where $E/G$ denotes the orbit space of $E$ with respect to the $G$-action (which can be proven to be proper) and $\xi$ is the quotient projection.
    \end{property}
    In fact this property can be used to give an alternative characterization of principal bundles:
    \begin{property}
        Consider a smooth manifold $P$ equipped with a free and proper (right) action of a Lie group $G$. The following statements hold:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The orbit space $P/G$ is a smooth manifold.
            \item The projection $P\rightarrow P/G$ is a submersion.
            \item $P$ is principal $G$-bundle over $P/G$.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{property}

    \begin{property}[Dimension]\label{diff:principal_bundle_dimension}
        The dimension of $P$ is given by
        \begin{gather}
            \dim P = \dim M + \dim G.
        \end{gather}
    \end{property}

    \begin{property}
        Every local trivialization $\varphi_i$ is $G$-equivariant:
        \begin{gather}
            \varphi_i(z\cdot g) = \varphi_i(z)\cdot g.
        \end{gather}
    \end{property}

    \newdef{Principal bundle map}{\index{bundle!map}
        A bundle map $F:P_1\rightarrow P_2$ between principal $G$-bundles is a pair of smooth maps $(f_B, f_P)$ such that:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item $(f_B, f_P)$ is a bundle map in the sense of fibre bundles.
            \item $f_P$ is $G$-equivariant.
        \end{enumerate}
        The map $f_P$ is said to \textbf{cover} $f_B$.
    }

    The following property proves that the equivariance condition on principal bundle maps is in fact a very strong condition:
    \begin{property}
        Every principal bundle map covering the identity is an isomorphism.
    \end{property}

    \newdef{Vertical automorphism}{\index{vertical!automorphism}\index{gauge!transformation}
        Consider a principal $G$-bundle $\pi:P\rightarrow M$. An automorphism $f$ of this bundle is said to be vertical if it covers the identity, i.e. $\pi\circ f = \pi$. It is the subgroup $\text{Aut}_V(P)\subset\text{Aut}(P)$ of vertical automorphisms that is known as the \textbf{group of gauge transformations} or \textbf{gauge group}\footnote{This should not be confused with the structure group $G$, which is also sometimes called the gauge group in physics.} in physics.
    }
    \sremark{It should be clear that the above definition can easily be generalized to arbitrary fibre bundles}

\subsection{Associated bundles}

    \begin{construct}[Associated principal bundle]\label{diff:associated_bundle_construction}
        For every fibre bundle one can construct an associated principal $G$-bundle by replacing the fibre $F$ by $G$ itself using the fibre bundle construction theorem \ref{diff:fibre_bundle_construction_theorem} where the left action of $G$ is given by left multiplication in $G$.
    \end{construct}

    \begin{property}
        A fibre bundle $\xi$ is trivial if and only if its associated principal bundle is trivial. More generally, two fibre bundles are isomorphic if and only if their associated principal bundles are isomorphic.
    \end{property}

    \begin{example}[Frame bundle]\index{frame!bundle}\index{frame}\label{bundles:frame_bundle}
        Let $V$ be an $n$-dimensional vector space and denote the set of ordered bases (or \textbf{frames}) of $V$ by $FV$. It follows from the fact that every basis transformation is given by the action of an element of the general linear group that $FV$ is isomorphic to $\text{GL}(V)\cong\text{GL}(\mathbb{R}^n)$.

        Given an $n$-dimensional vector bundle $E$, one can thus construct an associated principal bundle by replacing every fibre $\pi^{-1}(b)$ by $F(\pi^{-1}(b))\cong\text{GL}(\mathbb{R}^n)$. The right action on this bundle by $g\in\text{GL}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ is given by the basis transformation $\widetilde{e}_j = g^i_je_i$.
    \end{example}

    \begin{construct}[Associated bundle to a principal bundle]\index{associated!bundle}\label{diff:prin:associated_bundle}
        Consider a principal $G$-bundle $\pi:P\rightarrow M$ and let $F$ be a smooth manifold equipped with a left $G$-action $\vartriangleright$. One can then construct an associated bundle $P_F \equiv P \times_\vartriangleright F$ in the following way:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Define an equivalence relation $\sim_G$ on the product manifold $P\times F$ by
                \begin{gather}
                    \label{diff:associated_bundle_equivalence}
                    (p, f)\sim_G (p', f')\iff \exists g\in G: (p',f') = (p\cdot g, g^{-1}\vartriangleright f).
                \end{gather}
            \item The total space of the associated bundle is given by the following quotient manifold:
                \begin{gather}
                    P_F := (P\times F)/\sim_G.
                \end{gather}
            \item The projection map $\pi_F:P_F\rightarrow M$ is defined as
                \begin{gather}
                    \pi_F:[p,f]\mapsto \pi(p)
                \end{gather}
            where $[p,f]$ is the equivalence class of $(p,f)\in P\times F$ in the quotient manifold $P_F$.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{construct}

    \begin{example}[Tangent bundle]
        Starting from the frame bundle $FM$ over a manifold $M$ one can reconstruct (up to a bundle isomorphism) the tangent bundle $TM$ in the following way:

        Consider the left $G$-action $\vartriangleright$ given by
        \begin{gather}
            \vartriangleright:G\times\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^n : (g\vartriangleright f)^i = g^i_{\ j}f^j.
        \end{gather}
        The tangent bundle is isomorphic to the associated bundle $FM\times_\vartriangleright\mathbb{R}^n$ where the bundle map is defined as $[e,v]\mapsto v^ie_i \in TM$.
    \end{example}

    \begin{construct}[Associated bundle map]\index{bundle!map}
        Given a principal bundle map $(f_P,f_B)$ between two principal bundles one can construct an associated bundle map between any two of their associated bundles with the same typical fibre in the following way:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item The total space map $\widetilde{f}_P:P\times_G F\rightarrow P\times_{G'} F$ is given by
                \begin{gather}
                    \widetilde{f}_P([p, f]) := [f_P(p), f].
                \end{gather}
            \item The base space map is simply given by $f_B$ itself:
                \begin{gather}
                    \widetilde{f}_B(b) = f_B(b).
                \end{gather}
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{construct}

\subsection{Sections}

    Although every vector bundle has at least one global section, namely the zero section, a general principal bundle does not necessarily have a global section. This is made clear by the following property:
    \begin{property}[Trivial bundles]
        A principal $G$-bundle $P$ is trivial if and only if there exists a global section of $P$. Furthermore, there exists a bijection between the set of global sections $\Gamma(P)$ and the set of trivializations $\text{Triv}(P)$.
    \end{property}
    \begin{result}\label{diff:prin_section_triv}
        Every local section $\sigma:U\rightarrow P$ induces a local trivialization $\varphi$ by
        \begin{gather}
            \varphi^{-1}:(m, g)\mapsto \sigma(m)\cdot g.
        \end{gather}
        The converse is also true: Consider a local trivialization $\psi^{-1}:U\times G\rightarrow \pi^{-1}(U)$. A local section can be obtained by taking $\sigma(u):=\psi^{-1}(u, e)$.
    \end{result}

    Property \ref{diff:trivial_vector_bundle} can now be reformulated as follows:
    \begin{property}[Trivial vector bundles]
        A vector bundle is trivial if and only if its associated frame bundle admits a global section. This can easily be interpreted as follows: If one can for every fibre choose a basis in a smooth way, then one can also express the restriction of any vector field to a fibre in terms of this basis in a smooth way.
    \end{property}

    \begin{property}[Higgs fields]\label{diff:section_bijection}\index{Higgs!field}
        Let $\prb$ be a principal bundle and let $P_F$ be an associated bundle. There exists a bijection between the sections of $P_F$ and the $G$-equivariant maps $\phi:P\rightarrow F$, i.e. maps satisfying $\phi(p\cdot g) = g^{-1}\cdot\phi(p)$.

        An explicit correspondence is given by
        \begin{gather}
            \sigma_\phi:M\rightarrow P_F:m\mapsto [p, \phi(p)]
        \end{gather}
        where $p$ is any point in $\pi^{-1}(\{m\})$. This is well-defined due to equation \ref{diff:associated_bundle_equivalence}. In the other direction one finds
        \begin{gather}
            \label{diff:section_bijection_phi}
            \phi_\sigma:P\rightarrow F: p\mapsto j_p^{-1}\circ\sigma(\pi(p))
        \end{gather}
        where $j_p:F\rightarrow P_F:f\mapsto[p, f]$ is a bijection. Either of these maps ($\phi_\sigma$ or $\sigma_\phi$) is (sometimes) called a \textbf{Higgs field} in the physics literature.
    \end{property}

\section{Universal bundle}

    \newdef{Universal bundle}{\index{universal!bundle}\index{classifying!space}\label{diff:classifying_space}
        Consider a topological group $G$. A universal bundle of $G$ is any principal bundle of the form \[G\hookrightarrow EG\rightarrow BG\] where $EG$ is weakly contractible. The space $BG$ is called the \textbf{classifying space} of $G$.
    }
    \begin{property}
        A principal $G$-bundle $EG\rightarrow BG$ is universal if and only if $EG$ is weakly contractible.
    \end{property}
    \newdef{$n$-universal bundle}{
        A principal bundle with an $(n-1)$-connected total space.
    }
    \begin{property}[Delooping]\index{delooping}\label{diff:delooping}
        For every topological group one can prove that the loop space of $BG$ is (weakly) homotopy equivalent to $G$, i.e. $\Omega BG\cong G$. As such it also deserves the name of delooping.
    \end{property}

    \begin{property}[Classification]\label{diff:classification}
        The collection of principal $G$-bundles over a paracompact space $X$ is in bijection with $[X, BG]$, the set of homotopy classes of continuous functions $f:X\rightarrow BG$. This bijection is given by the pullback-construction $f\mapsto f^*EG$.

        Due to the homotopical nature of this classification one can also replace $G$ by any homotopy equivalent space. For Lie groups the natural choice is a \textit{maximal compact subgroup} since these are deformation retracts and hence homotopy equivalent.
    \end{property}
    \begin{result}[Vector bundles]\index{vector!bundle}\index{metric}
        Since every vector bundle is uniquely related to its frame bundle, there exists a bijection between principal $\text{GL}$-bundles and vector bundles. This implies that rank-$k$ vector bundles are also classified by the homotopy mapping space $[X,B\text{GL}_k]$. Because $\text{O}(n)$ is the maximal compact subgroup of $\text{GL}(n)$, one also obtains the result that any real vector bundle over a paracompact space admits a bundle metric.

        Property \ref{diff:vector_bundles_over_sphere} now follows from Eckmann-Hilton duality \ref{topology:eckmann_hilton} together with the above delooping property.
    \end{result}

    \remark{There also exists a slightly different notion of universal bundles and their associated classifying property. When one requires the total space of the universal bundle to be contractible instead of weakly contractible, the mapping space $[X,BG]$ only classifies numerable principal bundles \ref{diff:numerable_bundle}, but now over arbitrary base spaces $X$.}

    An explicit construction of the numerable universal bundle for any topological group $G$ was given by Milnor:
    \begin{construct}[\difficult{Milnor}]\index{Milnor!construction}
        First, consider the infinite join $E_\infty$ equipped with the strong topology. This space is constructed as the direct limit of finite joins \[E_n=\underbrace{G\circ\cdots\circ G}_{n\text{ times}}\] where $E_n$ is embedded in $E_{n+1}$ using the identity element. Then, construct the quotient of $E_n$ (resp. $E_\infty$) by the canonical right action of $G$ on $E_n$ (resp. $E_\infty$). The bundle $p_n:E_n\rightarrow B_n$ (resp. $p:E_\infty\rightarrow B_\infty$) is an $n$-universal bundle (resp. $\infty$-universal bundle). It follows from the above property that $p:E_\infty\rightarrow B_\infty$ is a universal bundle for $G$.
    \end{construct}

    \begin{construct}[\difficult{Category theory}]
        Let $G$ be a topological group and consider the delooping (groupoid) $\mathbf{B}G$ from definition \ref{cat:group_delooping}. This groupoid can also be obtained as the \textit{action groupoid} associated to the trivial action of $G$ on $\{\ast\}$. The regular action of $G$ on itself also induces an action groupoid $\mathbf{E}G:=G//G$. The map $G\rightarrow\{\ast\}$ in turn induces a map of groupoids $\mathbf{E}G\rightarrow\mathbf{B}G$ which under geometric realisation gives us a universal bundle map.

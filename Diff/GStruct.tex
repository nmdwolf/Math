\chapter{\texorpdfstring{$G$-Structures}{G-Structures}}

	In the following table we give an overview of the more common $G$-structures one can define on a smooth (simply-connected) manifolds $M^n$.
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l|c|X|}
			 \hline
			 	Geometric structure&Structure group&Remarks\\
			 \hline
			 	Orientation&SL$(n, \mathbb{R})$&GL$^+(n, \mathbb{R})$ is sufficient for orientability. The special linear group gives rise to a volume form.\\
			 	Riemannian metric&$O(n)$&\\&&\\
			 	Almost-symplectic structure*&Sp$(n, \mathbb{R})$&Integrability (in the form of a closed form) gives a symplectic manifold.\\&&\\
			 	Almost-complex structure*&GL$(k, \mathbb{C})$&Integrability (in the form of Newlander-Nirenberg) gives a complex manifold.\\&&\\
			 	Almost-Hermitian structure*&U$(k)$&Integrability gives a K\"ahler manifold.\\&&\\
			 	Calabi-Yau*&SU$(k)$&\\&&\\
			 	Hyperk\"ahler**&Sp$(k)$&It follows that every hyperk\"ahler implies Calabi-Yau.\\&&\\
			 	Quaternionic-K\"ahler**\footnotemark&$(\text{Sp}(k)\times\text{Sp}(1))/\mathbb{Z}_2$&These manifolds are not strictly K\"ahler since the structure group is not a subgroup of U$(2k)$.\\

	\footnotetext{This definition additionally requires that $k>1$.}
	Structures marked with $\ast$ require the real dimension $n=2k$ to be even. Structures marked with $\ast\ast$ require the real dimension $n=4k$ to be a multiple of 4.
	
	\begin{remark*}
		This table is strongly related to the classification of (\textit{irreducible} simply-connected \textit{nonsymmetric}) Riemannian manifolds by \textit{Berger} (the first SL$(n, \mathbb{R})$-structure is technically not part of the original classification\footnote{It is not a subgroup of O$(n)$.}). A more general classification for manifolds which are not necessarily Riemannian was initiated by Berger and finished by others. However we will only mention it here, for references see \cite{diffgeom_physics}.
		
		Since these notions were not defined throughout this compendium we will explain them here:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Irreducible}: A Riemannian manifold is said to be irreducible if it is not locally isomorphic to a product of Riemannian manifolds.
			\item \textbf{Symmetric}\footnote{or \textbf{locally symmetric}}: A smooth manifold, locally modelled on $V\cong\mathbb{R}^n$, is said to be symmetric if the curvature mapping $F(M)\rightarrow\Lambda^2V^*\otimes\mathfrak{g}$ is covariantly constant.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{remark*}

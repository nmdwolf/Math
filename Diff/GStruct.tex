\chapter{\texorpdfstring{$G$-Structures}{G-Structures}}

	In the following table we give an overview of the more common $G$-structures one can define on a smooth (simply-connected) manifolds $M^n$.
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l|c|X|}
			 \hline
			 	Geometric structure&Structure group&Remarks\\
			 \hline
			 	Orientation&SL$_n(\mathbb{R})$&GL$^+_n(\mathbb{R})$ is sufficient for orientability. The special linear group gives rise to a volume form.\\
			 	Riemannian metric&$O(n)$&\\&&\\
			 	Almost-symplectic structure*&Sp$_{2k}(\mathbb{R})$&Integrability (in the form of a closed form) gives a symplectic manifold.\\&&\\
			 	Almost-complex structure*&GL$_k(\mathbb{C})$&Integrability (in the form of Newlander-Nirenberg) gives a complex manifold.\\&&\\
			 	Almost-Hermitian structure*&U$(k)$&Integrability gives a K\"ahler manifold.\\&&\\
			 	Calabi-Yau*&SU$(k)$&\\&&\\
			 	Hyperk\"ahler**&Sp$(k)$&It follows that every hyperk\"ahler implies Calabi-Yau.\\&&\\
			 	Quaternionic-K\"ahler**\footnotemark&$(\text{Sp}(k)\times\text{Sp}(1))/\mathbb{Z}_2$&These manifolds are not strictly K\"ahler since the structure group is not a subgroup of U$(2k)$.\\

	\footnotetext{This definition additionally requires that $k>1$.}
	Structures marked with $\ast$ require the real dimension $n=2k$ to be even. Structures marked with $\ast\ast$ require the real dimension $n=4k$ to be a multiple of 4.
	
	\begin{remark*}
		This table is strongly related to the classification of (irreducible simply-connected non-symmetric) Riemannian manifolds by \textit{Berger}.

\section{Lie groups}\label{section:lie_groups}

    \newdef{Lie group}{\index{Lie!group}\label{lie:lie_group}
        A group that is also a differentiable manifold such that both the multiplication and inversion maps are smooth functions.\footnote{For complex Lie groups one requires the definition of a complex manifold (see chapter \ref{chapter:complex_geometry}).}
    }
    \newdef{Lie subgroup}{
        A subset of a Lie group is called a Lie subgroup if it is both a subgroup and an immersed submanifold. If it is a regular submanifold, then it is sometimes called a \textbf{regular Lie subgroup}.
    }
    \begin{theorem}[Closed subgroup theorem\footnotemark]\index{Cartan}
        \footnotetext{Sometimes called \textbf{Cartan's theorem}.}
        If $H$ is a subgroup of a Lie group $G$, closed with respect to the topology of $G$, then $H$ is an regular Lie subgroup of $G$.
    \end{theorem}

    \begin{property}[Generating neighbourhoods]\label{lie:prop_connected}
        Let $G$ be a connected Lie group. Every neighbourhood $U_e$ of the identity $e$ generates $G$, i.e. every element $g\in G$ can be written as a word in $U_e$.
    \end{property}

    \newdef{Isogeny}{\index{isogeny}
        Let $G,H$ be two Lie groups. $G$ and $H$ are said to be isogenous if one is a covering space \ref{topology:covering_space} of the other. The covering map is then called an isogeny between $G$ and $H$.

\subsection{Left invariant vector fields}

    \newdef{Left-invariant vector field}{\index{vector field!left-invariant}
        \nomenclature[A_LIVF]{LIVF}{left-invariant vector field}
        \nomenclature[S_LIVF]{$\mathfrak{X}^L$}{space of left-invariant vector fields on a Lie group}
        Let $G$ be a Lie group and let $X$ be a vector field on $G$. $X$ is saoid to be left-invariant if the following equivariance relation holds for all $g\in G$:
        \begin{gather}
            L_{g,\ast}X(h) = X(gh)
        \end{gather}
        where $L$ denotes the regular (left) action on $G$. The term  ''left-invariant vector field'' is often abbreviated as \textbf{LIVF}.
    }
    \begin{property}
        The set $\mathfrak{X}^L(G)$ of LIVFs on a (real) Lie group $G$ is a vector space over $\mathbb{R}$.
    \end{property}
    \begin{property}[Tangent space]\label{lie:livf_prop}
        The map $L_{g,\ast}$ is an isomorphism for every $g\in G$. It follows that a LIVF is uniquely determined by its value at the identity of $G$. Furthermore, for every $v\in T_eG$ there exists a LIVF $X\in\mathfrak{X}^L(G)$ such that $X(e)=v$ and this mapping is an isomorphism from $T_eG$ to $\mathfrak{X}^L(G)$.
    \end{property}

\subsection{One-parameter subgroups}

    \newdef{One-parameter subgroup}{\index{one-parameter subgroup}\label{group:one_parameter_subgroup}
        A one-parameter subgroup (of a Lie group $G$) is a Lie group morphism $\Phi:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow G$ from the additive group of real numbers to $G$.
    }
    \begin{property}\label{group:OPS_composition}
        Let $\Phi:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow G$ be a one-parameter subgroup of $G$ and let $\Psi:G\rightarrow H$ be a Lie group morphism. Then $\Psi\circ\Phi:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow H$ is a one-parameter subgroup of $H$.
    \end{property}
    \remark{The above definition and property can be generalized to the topological setting if we replace Lie group and Lie group morphism by topological group and continuous group morphism.}

    \begin{property}[Left-invariant vector fields]\label{lie:livf_subgroup}
        All LIVFs $X$ are complete\footnote{See definition \ref{diff:complete_vector_field} for a general statement.}, i.e. for every LIVF $X$ we can find an integral curve $\gamma_X$ with initial condition $\gamma_X(0) = e$ for which the maximal flow domain\footnote{See definition \ref{diff:flow}.} $D(X)$ is $\mathbb{R}$. This implies that the associated flow $\sigma_t$ determines a one-parameter subgroup of $G$. Conversely, for every one-parameter subgroup $\phi(t)$ we can construct a LIVF by taking $X := \phi'(0)$. This correspondence is in fact a bijection.
    \end{property}

\section{Lie algebras}

    There are two ways to define a Lie algebra. The first one is purely algebraic and consists of a vector space equipped with a multiplication operation satisfying certain conditions. The second one establishes a direct correspondence between Lie groups and Lie algebras.

\subsection{Definitions}

    \newdef{Lie algebra}{\index{Lie!algebra}\index{Lie!bracket}\index{Jacobi!identity}\label{linalgebra:lie_algebra}
        Let $V$ be a vector space equipped with a binary operation $[\cdot,\cdot]:V\times V\rightarrow V$, called the \textbf{Lie bracket}. $(V,[\cdot,\cdot])$ is a Lie algebra if the Lie bracket satisfies the following conditions:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Bilinearity}: $[ax+y,z] = a[x,z] + [y, ]$,
            \item \textbf{Alternativity}: $[v,v] = 0$, and
            \item \textbf{Jacobi identity}: $[a,[b,c]] + [b,[c,a]] + [c,[a,b]] = 0$.
        \end{enumerate}
    }
    \remark{Note that often the alternativity condition is replaced by an antisymmetry condition. However, this is only equivalent over fields of characteristic $\neq2$. For $\text{char}(K)=2$ we only have that alternativity implies antisymmetry. Since we will almost exclusively work over fields such as $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$, this will not pose any problems and hence we will always use the antisymmetry condition.}

    \newdef{Poisson algebra}{\index{Poisson!algebra}\index{Poisson!bracket}\label{lie:poisson_algebra}
        A vector space $V$ equipped with two bilinear operations $\star$ and $\{\cdot,\cdot\}$ that satisfy the following conditions:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item The couple $(V,\star)$ is an associative algebra.
            \item The couple $(V,\{\cdot,\cdot\})$ is a Lie algebra.
            \item The \textbf{Poisson bracket} $\{\cdot,\cdot\}$ acts as a derivation \ref{diff:derivation} with respect to the operation $\star$, i.e. \[\{x,y\star z\} = \{x,y\}\star z + y\star\{x,z\}.\]
        \end{enumerate}
    }

    \newdef{Structure constants}{\index{structure!constants}
        Because Lie algebras are closed under the Lie bracket, the Lie bracket of two basis elements can again be expressed in terms of the same basis $\{X_k\}_{k\in I}$:
        \begin{gather}
            [X_i,X_j] = \sum_{k\in I}c_{ij}^{\ \ k}X_k
        \end{gather}
        The coefficients $c_{ij}^{\ \ k}$ are called the structure constants of the Lie algebra. (Note that these constants are basis-dependent.)
    }
    \begin{property}[Isomorphism]
        Two Lie algebras $\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{h}$ are isomorphic if one can find bases $\mathcal{B}$ for $\mathfrak{g}$ and $\mathcal{C}$ for $\mathfrak{h}$ such that the associated structure constants are equal the same.
    \end{property}

    \begin{example}[Lie algebra of LIVFs]
        Consider the vector space $\mathfrak{X}^L(G)$ of LIVFs on a Lie group $G$. Using property \ref{diff:lie_bracket} we can show that the commutator (Lie bracket) also defines a LIVF on $G$. It follows that $\mathfrak{X}^L(G)$ is closed under Lie brackets and hence is a Lie algebra.
    \end{example}
    For the following alternative definition we use property \ref{lie:livf_prop} to relate the above Lie algebra of left-invariant vector fields and the tangent space to the identity:
    \newadef{Lie algebra of Lie group}{
        Let $G$ be a Lie group. The tangent space $\mathfrak{g}:=T_eG$ has the structure of a Lie algebra where the Lie bracket is induced by the commutator of vector fields \ref{diff:lie_bracket} in the following way:
        \begin{gather}
            [A,B]_{\mathfrak{g}} := L_{g^{-1},*}\left[L_{g,*}A, L_{g,*}B\right]
        \end{gather}
        where $A,B\in T_eG$ and where $[\cdot,\cdot]$ denotes the Lie bracket on $\mathfrak{X}^L(G)$. This induces an isomorphism of Lie algebras: $\mathfrak{g}\cong\mathfrak{X}^L(G)$. We will freely use this isomorphism throughout this text (and thereby also abuse the notation $[\cdot,\cdot]$).
    }

    \begin{notation}
        Lie algebras are generally denoted by fraktur symbols. For example, the Lie algebra associated with the Lie group $G$ is often denoted by $\mathfrak{g}$.
    \end{notation}

    \begin{theorem}[Ado]\index{Ado}\label{lie:theorem:ado}
        Every finite-dimensional Lie algebra can be embedded as a subalgebra of $\mathfrak{gl}_n \cong \textup{M}_n$.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{theorem}[Lie's third theorem]\index{Lie!third theorem}
        Every finite-dimensional Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ is the Lie algebra of a unique simply-connected Lie group $G$.
    \end{theorem}

    \newdef{Lie algebra morphism}{\index{morphism!of Lie algebras}
        A map $\Phi:\mathfrak{g}\rightarrow\mathfrak{h}$ is a Lie algebra morphism if it satisfies the following condition
        \begin{gather}
            \Phi([X,Y]) = [\Phi(X),\Phi(Y)]
        \end{gather}
        for all $X,Y\in\mathfrak{g}$.
    }
    \begin{property}[Homomorphism theorem\footnotemark]\label{lie:prop_hom}
        \footnotetext{Also called \textbf{Lie's second theorem}.}
        Let $G,H$ be two Lie groups with $G$ simply-connected. Every Lie algebra morphism $\Phi:\mathfrak{g}\rightarrow\mathfrak{h}$ corresponds to a unique Lie group morphism $\phi:G\rightarrow H$ such that $\Phi=\phi_*$. Conversely, every Lie group morphism induces a Lie algebra morphism through its differential (see formula \ref{lie:induced_homomorphism}).
    \end{property}

    \newdef{Derivation}{\index{derivation}
        Given a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ we define the space of derivations $\text{Der}(\mathfrak{g})$ as the space of linear maps $d$ such that
        \begin{gather}
            d([x,y]) = [dx,y] + [x,dy]
        \end{gather}
        for all $x,y\in\mathfrak{g}$. This vector space becomes a Lie algebra when equipped with the commutator of linear maps.
    }

\subsection{Exponential map}

    \newformula{Exponential map}{\index{exponential map}
        Let $X$ be a LIVF on $G$. We define the exponential map $\exp:\mathfrak{g}\rightarrow G$ as
        \begin{gather}
            \exp(X) := \gamma_X(1)
        \end{gather}
        where $\gamma_X$ is the associated one-parameter subgroup defined in property \ref{lie:livf_subgroup}.
    }

    \begin{property}[Uniqueness]
        The exponential map is the unique map $\mathfrak{g}\rightarrow G$ such that exp$(0) = e$ and for which the restrictions to the lines through the origin in $\mathfrak{g}$ are one-parameter subgroups of $G$.
    \end{property}
    \begin{result}\label{lie:exp_result}
        Because the identity element $\mathbbm{1}_\mathfrak{g}=\exp_\ast$ is an isomorphism, the inverse function theorem \ref{diff:inverse_function_theorem} implies that the image of $\exp$ will contain a neighbourhood of the identity $e\in G$. If $G$ is connected then property \ref{lie:prop_connected} implies that the exponential map generates all of $G$.

        Together with the property that $\psi\circ\exp = \exp\circ\ \psi_\ast$ for every Lie group morphism $\psi:G\rightarrow H$, we can conclude that \textit{if $G$ is connected, a Lie group morphism $\psi:G\rightarrow H$ is completely determined by its differential $\psi_\ast$ at the identity $e\in G$}.
    \end{result}

    \begin{example}[Matrix Lie groups]\index{matrix!exponentiation}
        For matrix Lie groups we can define the classic matrix exponential:
        \begin{gather}
            e^{tX} := \sum_{k=0}^{+\infty}\stylefrac{(tX)^k}{k!}.
        \end{gather}
        This operation defines a one-parameter subgroup $\gamma(t)$ of $G$ and from the uniqueness property above it follows that this matrix exponential is in fact the exponential map for $G$. It should be noted that this formula converges for every $X\in M_{m,n}$ and that it is invertible with inverse given by $\exp(-X)$. Using Ado's theorem \ref{lie:theorem:ado} one can then use this matrix exponential to represent the exponential map for any (finite-dimensional) Lie algebra.
    \end{example}

    \begin{remark}
        If $G$ is a compact Lie group, the exponential map is surjective. However, because the associated Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ is clearly noncompact, the exponential map cannot be homeomorphic and hence cannot be injective.
    \end{remark}

    \newformula{Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula}{\index{Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula}
        \nomenclature[A_BCH]{BCH}{Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff}
        Consider the equation
        \begin{gather}
            Z = \log(\exp(X)\exp(X))
        \end{gather}
        where $X,Y\in\mathfrak{g}$. The solution is given by the following formula:
        \begin{gather}
            \label{lie:bch_formula}
            e^Xe^Y = \exp\left(X + Y + \frac{1}{2}[X,Y] + \frac{1}{12}[X,[X,Y]] - \frac{1}{12}[Y,[X,Y]] + \cdots\right).
        \end{gather}
        One should note that this formula will only converge if $X, Y$ are sufficiently small (for matrix Lie algebras this means that $||X|| + ||Y|| < \frac{\ln(2)}{2}$ under the Hilbert-Schmidt norm \ref{linalgebra:hilbert_schmidt_norm}). Due to the closure under the Lie bracket, the exponent in the BCH formula is also an element of the Lie algebra. So this formula gives an expression for Lie group multiplication in terms of (Lie brackets of) Lie algebra elements (whenever the formula converges).
    }
    \begin{result}[Lie product formula\footnotemark]\index{Trotter expansion|see{Lie-Trotter formula}}\index{Lie-Trotter formula}
        \footnotetext{Also called the \textbf{Lie-Trotter formula}. Later, extensions where given by \textit{Kato} and \textit{Suzuki} for certain unbounded operators.}
        Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a Lie algebra. The following formula applies to any $X,Y\in\mathfrak{g}$:
        \begin{gather}
            \label{lie:lie_product_formula}
            e^{X+Y} = \lim_{n\rightarrow+\infty}\left(e^{\frac{X}{n}}e^{\frac{Y}{n}}\right)^n.
        \end{gather}
    \end{result}

\subsection{Examples}

    \begin{example}
        The cross product $\times:\mathbb{R}^3\times\mathbb{R}^3\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^3$ turns $\mathbb{R}^3$ into a Lie algebra.
    \end{example}
    \begin{example}
        An interesting example is the Lie algebra associated to the Lie group of invertible complex\footnote{This result is also valid for real matrices.} matrices $\text{GL}(n, \mathbb{C})$. This Lie group is a subset of its own Lie algebra $\mathfrak{gl}(n, \mathbb{C}) = M_n(\mathbb{C})$. It follows that for every $A\in\text{GL}(n, \mathbb{C})$ and every $B\in\mathfrak{gl}(n, \mathbb{C})$ the following equality holds:
        \begin{gather}
            L_{A,*}(B)=L_A(B).
        \end{gather}
    \end{example}
    \begin{result}\label{lie:end_as_lie_algebra}
        By noting that the endomorphism ring $\text{End}(V)$ of an $n$-dimensional vector space $V$ is given by the matrix ring $M_n(K)$, we see that $\text{End}(V)$ also forms a Lie algebra when equipped with the commutator of linear maps.
    \end{result}

    \begin{example}[Isometries]\index{isometry}
        The Lie algebra associated with the group of isometries $\text{Isom}(V)$ of a nondegenerate Hermitian form satisfies the condition
        \begin{gather}
            \label{lie:lie_isometry}
            \langle Xv,w \rangle = -\langle v,Xw \rangle
        \end{gather}
        for all Lie algebra elements $X$. It follows that the Lie algebra consists of all skew-Hermitian operators.
    \end{example}
    We give two explicit examples:
    \begin{example}[Lie algebra of $\text{O}(3)$]\label{lie:so3}
        This Lie algebra is isomorphic to the set of $3\times3$ skew-symmetric matrices. It is important to note that $\mathfrak{o}(3)=\mathfrak{so}(3)$. The structure constants of this Lie algebra are given by the Levi-Civita symbol \ref{tensor:levi_civita_symbol}, i.e. $c_{ijk}=\varepsilon_{ijk}$.
    \end{example}
    \begin{example}[Lie algebra of $\text{SU}(2)$]
        This Lie algebra is isomorphic to the set of $2\times2$ traceless skew-Hermitian matrices. This result can be generalized to arbitrary $n\in\mathbb{N}$.
    \end{example}
    Another important example is obtained by restricting $\text{GL}(2, \mathbb{C})$ to the subset of matrices with unit determinant:
    \begin{example}[Lie algebra of $\text{SL}(2, \mathbb{C})$]
        To compute the Lie bracket of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb{C})$ we need to find the action of $l_{g,*}$ on any vector $Y\in\mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb{C})$. This is given by:
        \begin{gather}
            l_{\left(\begin{smallmatrix}a&b\\c&d\end{smallmatrix}\right), *}\left(\left.\pderiv{}{x^i}\right|_e\right)
            = \left(\begin{matrix}a&0&b\\-b&a&0\\c&0&\frac{1+bc}{a}\end{matrix}\right)^m_i\left.\pderiv{}{x^m}\right|_{\left(\begin{smallmatrix}a&b\\c&d\end{smallmatrix}\right)}
        \end{gather}
        where we used the coordinate chart $(U,\phi)$ defined by \[U = \left\{\left(\begin{matrix}a&b\\c&d\end{matrix}\right)\in\text{SL}(2, \mathbb{C}): a\neq0\right\}\] and \[\phi:U\rightarrow\mathbb{C}^3:\left(\begin{matrix}a&b\\c&d\end{matrix}\right)\mapsto(a,b,c).\] One can then use this formula to work out the Lie bracket of the basis vectors $X_i = \left.\pderiv{}{x^i}\right|_e$ to obtain the following structure constants:
        \begin{align}
            \label{lie:sl2c_lie_brackets}
            [X_1,X_2] &= 2X_2\nonumber\\
            [X_1,X_3] &= -2X_3\\
            [X_2,X_3] &= X_1.\nonumber
        \end{align}
    \end{example}

    \newdef{Normalizer}{\index{normalizer}

    \newdef{Derived algebra}{\index{derived!algebra}
        Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a Lie algebra. The derived Lie algebra is defined as follows:

        \end{gather}
        If this sequence ends in the zero-space, then the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ is said to be solvable.

        \begin{gather}
            [g,h] := \rho(g)(h)
        \end{gather}
        for all $g\in\mathfrak{g},h\in\mathfrak{h}$. This also turns $\mathfrak{h}$ into an ideal.

        \end{gather}

    \begin{construct}[Extension by cocycles]\index{cocycle!Lie algebra}
        Consider a Lie algebra morphism $\Theta:\mathfrak{g}\times\mathfrak{g}\rightarrow\mathfrak{a}$ with the following properties:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item $\Theta$ is bilinear,
            \item $\Theta$ is antisymmetric, and
            \item $\Theta([a,b], c) + \Theta([b,c], a) + \Theta([c,a], b) = 0$.
        \end{enumerate}
        Such a morphism is called a \textbf{Lie algebra 2-cocycle}.\footnote{See section \ref{section:lie_algebra_cohomology} further below for more information.} Now, every 2-cocycle $\Theta:\mathfrak{g}\times\mathfrak{g}\rightarrow\mathfrak{a}$ induces a central extension of $\mathfrak{g}$ by $\mathfrak{a}$ in the following way:

        \qquad Because the exact sequences characterizing central extensions (of Lie algebras) are in particular short exact sequences of vector spaces, they always split and hence we can always choose $\mathfrak{h}=\mathfrak{g}\oplus\mathfrak{a}$ to be the underlying vector space. The Lie bracket on this space is then defined as follows:
        \begin{gather}
            [g\oplus\lambda,g'\oplus\mu] := [g,g']_{\mathfrak{g}} \oplus \Theta(g,g').
        \end{gather}
    \end{construct}

\subsection{Lie groups}

    \newdef{Representation of Lie groups}{\index{representation}
        Let $G$ be a Lie group and let $V$ be a vector space. A representation of $G$ on $V$ is a Lie group morphism $\rho:G\rightarrow\text{GL}(V)$.

        \nomenclature[O_Adg]{$\text{Ad}_g$}{Adjoint representation of a Lie group $G$.}
        Let $G$ be a Lie group. Consider the adjoint action $\text{Ad}_g:h\mapsto ghg^{-1}$. The adjoint representation of $G$ on $\mathfrak{g}$ is defined as the differential $\text{Ad}_{g,*}$ at the identity element. For matrix Lie groups this becomes (where we use the same notion)
        \begin{gather}
            \text{Ad}_g:T_eG\rightarrow T_eG:X\mapsto gXg^{-1}.
        \end{gather}
    \end{example}

\subsection{Lie algebras}

    \newdef{Representation of Lie algebras}{
        Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a Lie algebra and let $V$ be a vector space. A representation of $\mathfrak{g}$ on $V$ is a Lie algebra morphism $\rho:\mathfrak{g}\rightarrow\text{End}(V)$.

    \newformula{Adjoint representation of Lie algebras}{
        \nomenclature[O_adX]{$\text{ad}_X$}{Adjoint representation of a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$.}
        Using the fact that the adjoint representation of Lie groups is smooth we can define the adjoint representation of Lie algebras as
        \begin{gather}
           \text{ad}_X := \text{Ad}_{g,*}
        \end{gather}
        where $g=e^{tX}$. More explicitly, the adjoint map is given by
        \begin{gather}
            \label{lie:bracket_as_adjoint_rep}
            \text{ad}_X(Y) = [X,Y]
        \end{gather}
        for all $X,Y\in\mathfrak{g}$.
    }

    \begin{property}[$\text{Ad}$ is faithful]
        The adjoint representation ad$_X$ is faithful.
    \end{property}

    \begin{property}[Jacobi identity]
        Given the antisymmetry of the Lie bracket, the Jacobi identity is equivalent to ad$:\mathfrak{g}\rightarrow\text{End}(\mathfrak{g})$ being a Lie algebra morphism, i.e. $\text{ad}_{[X,Y]} = [\text{ad}_X,\text{ad}_Y]$.
    \end{property}

    \begin{formula}[Structure constants]
        Let $\{e_i\}_{i\leq n}$ be a basis of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. The structure constants are related to the adjoint representation as follows:
        \begin{gather}
            \label{lie:ad_structure_constant}
            (\text{ad}_{e_i})^j_k = C_{ik}^{\ \ j}
        \end{gather}
    \end{formula}

    \newformula{Induced morphism}{\index{morphism!induced}\label{lie:induced_homomorphism}
        Let $\phi:G\rightarrow H$ be a Lie group morphism\footnote{Continuity (inherent to the definition of a Lie group morphism) is needed to ensure that $\phi(e^{tX})$ is also a one-parameter subgroup (see \ref{group:OPS_composition}).} with $G$ connected and simply-connected. This morphism induces a
 a Lie algebra morphism\footnote{See also property \ref{lie:prop_hom}.} $\Phi:\mathfrak{g}\rightarrow\mathfrak{h}$ given by
        \begin{gather}
            \Phi(X) := \left.\deriv{}{t}\phi\left(e^{tX}\right)\right|_{t=0}
        \end{gather}
        or equivalently
        \begin{gather}
            \phi\left(e^{tX}\right) = e^{t\Phi(X)}.
        \end{gather}
    }

    The morphism induced by $\text{Ad}:G\rightarrow H$ is precisely $\text{ad}:\mathfrak{g}\rightarrow\mathfrak{h}$. Informally we can thus say that the infinitesimal version of the similarity transformation is given by the commutator:
    \begin{result}[Commutator]\index{commutator}
        For the algebra of the general linear group $\text{GL}_n$ the Lie bracket is given by the commutator:
        \begin{gather}
            [X,Y] := XY-YX.
        \end{gather}
        This follows from definition \ref{lie:bracket_as_adjoint_rep}: $[X, Y] = \left.\deriv{}{t}\text{Ad}_{\gamma(t)}(Y)\right|_{t=0}$ with $\gamma(0) = e$ and $\gamma'(0) = X$.
    \end{result}

\subsection{Coadjoint orbits}\label{section:coadjoint_orbits}

    The main reference for this section is \cite{witten_coadjoint}.

    \newdef{Coadjoint representation}{\index{coadjoint}
        The representation of a Lie group $G$ on the dual space $\mathfrak{g}^*$ defined by
        \begin{gather}
            \langle \text{Ad}_g^*(\omega),v \rangle := \langle \omega,\text{Ad}_g^{-1}(v) \rangle.
        \end{gather}
        Infinitesimally this induces a representation of $\mathfrak{g}$ on its linear dual. It is given by
        \begin{gather}
            K_*(X):\omega\mapsto -\omega\circ\text{ad}_X.
        \end{gather}
    }

    \newdef{Coadjoint orbit}{
        Given an element $\omega\in\mathfrak{g}^*$, one defines the coadjoint orbit $\Omega_\omega$ as the orbit of $\omega$ under the action of $G$. This orbit can also be defined as the homogeneous space $G/G_\omega$.
    }

    The following important construction shows that every coadjoint orbit is in fact canonically a symplectic manifold\footnote{See chapter \ref{chapter:symplectic}.}:
    \newdef{Kirillov-Kostant-Souriau form}{\index{Kirillov-Kostant-Souriau form}
        First define the antisymmetric bilinear map $B_\alpha:\mathfrak{g}\times\mathfrak{g}\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$ by the following formula:
        \begin{gather}
            B_\alpha(X,Y) := \langle \alpha,[X,Y] \rangle.
        \end{gather}
        Now, consider a coadjoint orbit $\Omega_\alpha$. Since $\alpha$ is an element of the coadjoint representation of $G$, the tangent vectors to $\Omega_\alpha$ (at $\alpha$) are naturally elements of the induced representation of $\mathfrak{g}$. Hence for any tangent vector $v$ one can consider $v:=K_*(X)\alpha$ for some $X\in\mathfrak{g}$. Now, define a two-form on $\Omega_\alpha$ by the following formula:
        \begin{gather}
            \omega_\alpha(v,w) = B_\alpha(X,Y)
        \end{gather}
        where $X,Y$ are the adjoint vectors generating the tangent vectors $v,w$. That this actually defines a symplectic form is not hard to prove.
    }

\section{Structure}
\subsection{Killing form}

    \newdef{Killing form}{\index{Killing!form}\index{Cartan-Killing|see{Killing form}}
        Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a finite-dimensional Lie algebra. The Killing form (sometimes \textbf{Cartan-Killing} form) on $\mathfrak{g}$ is defined as the following symmetric bilinear form:
        \begin{gather}
            \label{lie:killing_form}
            K(X,Y) := \text{tr}(\text{ad}_X\circ\text{ad}_Y).
        \end{gather}
        The trace can be calculated by choosing a (finite-dimensional) representation of the Lie algebra using Ado's theorem \ref{lie:theorem:ado}.

        From equation \ref{lie:ad_structure_constant} we can find out the value of the Killing form on the basis $\{e_i\}_{i\leq n}$:
        \begin{gather}
            K_{ij} = c_{ik}^{\ \ l}c_{jl}^{\ \ k}
        \end{gather}
        where $c_{ij}^{\ \ k}$ are the structure constants of the Lie algebra.
    }

    \begin{theorem}[Cartan's criterion]\index{Cartan!criterion}
        A Lie algebra is semisimple if and only if its Killing form is nondegenerate.
    \end{theorem}

    \begin{property}
        If a Lie group $G$ is compact, the Killing form of its associated Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ is negative-definite.
    \end{property}
    \begin{result}
        Let $G$ be a compact Lie group. If its Lie algebra is semisimple, the Killing form $K$ induces a metric
        \begin{gather}
            g:(X,Y)\mapsto -\ \text{tr}(\text{ad}_X\circ\text{ad}_Y) = -K(X,Y)
        \end{gather}
        which turns the corresponding Lie group $G$ into a Riemannian manifold.
    \end{result}

    \begin{property}[Killing form is invariant]
        The Killing-form is $\text{Ad}$-invariant:
        \begin{gather}
            K(\text{Ad}_g(X),\text{Ad}_g(Y)) = K(X,Y)
        \end{gather}
        for all $g\in G$. From this it follows that $\text{Ad}$ is a morphism $G\rightarrow\text{Isom}(\mathfrak{g})$.
    \end{property}
    \begin{result}
        The adjoint map $\text{ad}_Z$ is antisymmetric with respect to the Killing form:
        \begin{gather}
            \label{lie:ad_killing_form}
            K(\text{ad}_ZX,Y) = -K(X,\text{ad}_ZY).
        \end{gather}
    \end{result}

    \begin{property}[Invariant forms]\label{lie:killing_trace}
        For a simple Lie algebra, every ($\text{ad}$-)invariant symmetric bilinear form is a scalar multiple of the Killing form.
    \end{property}
    \begin{example}
        For $\mathfrak{su}(n)$ the trace can easily be seen to be $\text{ad}$-invariant and hence satisfies the above property. The exact relation is given by
        \begin{gather}
            \text{tr}(XY) = 2nK(X,Y).
        \end{gather}
    \end{example}

    \begin{property}[Antisymmetric structure constants]\index{structure!constants}
        When the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ is compact and semisimple, i.e. when the Killing form induces a metric, one can find a basis of $\mathfrak{g}$, constructed by orthonormalizing a given basis with respect to the Killing metric\footnote{The proof uses the ad-invariance of the Killing form.}, such that the structure constants are invariant under cyclic permutation of the indices:
        \begin{gather}
            c_{ijk} = c_{jki}.
        \end{gather}
        A corollary of this property is also that the structure constants become totally antisymmetric.
    \end{property}

    \begin{construct}[Induced Killing form]
        Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a Lie algebra and let $V$ be a vector space equipped with a Lie algebra representation $\rho:\mathfrak{g}\rightarrow\text{End}(V)$. We can define a Killing form associated with $\rho$ in the following way:
        \begin{gather}
            \label{lie:rho_killing_form}
            K_\rho(X,Y) := \text{tr}\big(\rho(X)\circ\rho(Y)\big)
        \end{gather}
        This definition is a generalization of \ref{lie:killing_form} which reduces to the Killing form $K$ when choosing $V$ to be $\mathfrak{g}$ the adjoint representation.
    \end{construct}

\subsection{Weights, roots and Dynkin diagrams}

    From here on we assume the base field to be algebraically closed (in fact, let us choose $\mathbb{C}$ for simplicity).

    \newdef{Cartan subalgebra}{\index{Cartan!subalgebra}
        Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a Lie algebra. A subalgebra $\mathfrak{h}$ is called a Cartan subalgebra if it satisfies the following two conditions:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Nilpotency}: Its lower central series terminates:
                \begin{gather}
                    \exists n\in\mathbb{N}: \underbrace{[\mathfrak{h},[\mathfrak{h}, [\mathfrak{h},\ldots]]]}_{n\text{ times}} = 0.
                \end{gather}
            \item \textbf{Self-normalizing}:
                \begin{gather}
                    \forall X\in\mathfrak{h}:[X,Y]\in\mathfrak{h}\implies Y\in\mathfrak{h}.
                \end{gather}
        \end{enumerate}
    }

    From here one we will also assume that all Lie algebras are finite-dimensional. This assumption is motivated by the following property:
    \begin{property}
        Every finite-dimensional Lie algebra contains a Cartan subalgebra.
    \end{property}
    \begin{property}
       If $\mathfrak{g}$ is semisimple, then its Cartan subalgebra is Abelian.
    \end{property}

    \begin{construct}
        Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a semisimple Lie algebra. A Cartan subalgebra $\mathfrak{h}$ can be constructed as follows:

        \qquad Choose an integer $k\leq\dim(\mathfrak{g})$ together with $k$ linearly independent vectors $\{h_i\}_{i\leq k}$ such that for all $i,j\leq k:[h_i,h_j] = 0$.\footnote{The existence of such a choice, which is equivalent to requiring simultaneous diagonalization, is only guaranteed for semisimple Lie algebras.} If this set can be extended to a basis $\{h_i\}_{i\leq k}\cup\{g_j\}_{j\leq \dim(\mathfrak{g})-k}$ of $\mathfrak{g}$ such that every $g_j$ is a nontrivial eigenvector of the adjoint map $\text{ad}_{h_i}$ for all $i\in I$, then the algebra $\mathfrak{h} = \text{span}\{h_i\}_{i\leq k}$ is a Cartan subalgebra.
    \end{construct}

    \newdef{Weight space}{\index{weight}\index{module!weight}\label{lie:weight_space}
        Let $V$ be a representation of a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ with Cartan subalgebra $\mathfrak{h}$. For every linear functional $\lambda$ on $\mathfrak{h}$ we define the weight space $V_\lambda$ with \textbf{weight} $\lambda$ as follows:
        \begin{gather}
            V_\lambda := \{v\in V:h\cdot v=\lambda(H)v,\forall h\in\mathfrak{h}\}.
        \end{gather}
        Nonzero elements of a weight space are called \textbf{weight vectors}. If the representation $V$ can be decomposed as a direct sum of weigth spaces, it is called a \textbf{weight module}:
        \begin{gather}
            V = \bigoplus_{\lambda\in\mathfrak{h}^*}V_\lambda.
        \end{gather}
    }

    In the case where $V$ is the adjoint representation, the (nonzero) weights are called \textbf{roots}:
    \newdef{Root}{\index{root}
        Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a Lie algebra with Cartan subalgebra $\mathfrak{h}$. From the definition of a Cartan subalgebra it follows that for all $h\in\mathfrak{h}$:
        \begin{gather}
            [h,g_j]=\alpha_j(h)g_j
        \end{gather}
        where $\{g_j\}_{j\in J}$ is the basis extension of $\mathfrak{g}$ with respect to $\mathfrak{h}$. We have written the eigenvalues $\alpha_j(h)$ suggestively as maps acting on $\mathfrak{h}$. However, due to the definition of the $g_j$'s and the structure of the above formula, the $\alpha_j$'s are linear maps. By comparing the formula to the definition of weights above, we see that the $\alpha_j$'s are the weights of the adjoint representation. The nonzero weights are called the roots of $\mathfrak{g}$ and form the so-called \textbf{root system} $\Phi$.

        It follows that there exists a weight space decomposition of $\mathfrak{g}$:
        \begin{gather}
            \mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{h} \oplus \bigoplus_{\lambda\in\Phi}\mathfrak{g}_\lambda
        \end{gather}
        where the one-dimensional spaces $\mathfrak{g}_\lambda$ are the weight spaces associated to the roots $\lambda$ ($\mathfrak{h}$ is equal to $\mathfrak{g}_0$ in this notation).
    }

    \begin{property}
        If $\alpha\in\Phi$ then $-\alpha\in\Phi$. Furthermore, if $\alpha\in\Phi$ and $c\alpha\in\Phi$, then $c=\pm1$.
    \end{property}
    This property says that the root system $\Phi$ is not linearly independent. To introduce some kind of basis we define the following notion:
    \newdef{Simple root}{
        The set of simple roots $\Delta$ is a linearly independent subset of $\Phi$ such that every element $\lambda\in\Phi$ can be written as
        \begin{gather}
            \lambda = \pm\sum_i^na_i\lambda_i
        \end{gather}
        where $a_i\in\mathbb{N}$ and $\lambda_i\in\Delta$. (Such a set always exists.) This definition enforces the expansion coefficients $a_i$ of a certain root $\lambda$ to be either all positive or all negative.
    }

    More generally one can define the following equivalence relation on a root system:
    \newdef{Positive roots}{
        Let $\Phi$ be the root system of a given Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. Because the only scalar multiples of a root $\lambda\in\Phi$ in the root system are $\pm\lambda$, we can define a set of positive roots $\Phi^+$ as follows:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item $\lambda\in\Phi^+\implies-\lambda\not\in\Phi^+$, and
            \item $\alpha, \beta\in\Phi^+\land\alpha+\beta\in\Phi\implies\alpha+\beta\in\Phi^+$.
        \end{enumerate}
        The simple roots are then exactly the elements in $\Phi^+$ that cannot be written as a sum of other elements in $\Phi^+$.
    }

    \newdef{Triangular decomposition}{\index{Borel!subalgebra}
        Given a choice of positive roots $\Phi^+$ one can decompose the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ as follows:
        \begin{gather}
            \mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{n}_-\oplus\mathfrak{h}\oplus\mathfrak{n}_+
        \end{gather}
        where $\mathfrak{n}_\pm=\bigoplus_{\alpha\in\Phi^\pm}\mathfrak{g}_\alpha$. The subalgebra $\mathfrak{h}\oplus\mathfrak{n}_+$ is called the \textbf{Borel subalgebra}. It is the maximal solvable subalgebra of $\mathfrak{g}$.
    }

    \begin{property}[Rank]\index{rank!of Lie algebra}
        Let $\mathfrak{h}$ be a Cartan subalgebra. The set of simple roots $\Delta$ forms a basis for the dual space $\mathfrak{h}^*$ (over $\mathbb{C}$) and hence the cardinality of $\Delta$ is equal to the dimension of the Cartan subalgebra. This dimension is called the \textbf{rank} of the Lie algebra.
    \end{property}

    \newdef{Weyl group}{\index{Weyl!group}
        For every simple root $\lambda$ we construct a Householder transformation\footnote{See definition \ref{linalgebra:householder_transformation}.} $\sigma_\lambda$ as follows:
        \begin{gather}
            \sigma_\lambda:\text{span}_{\mathbb{R}}(\Delta)\rightarrow\text{span}_{\mathbb{R}}(\Delta):\mu\mapsto \mu - 2\frac{\langle\lambda,\mu\rangle}{\langle\lambda,\lambda\rangle}\lambda.
        \end{gather}
         The Weyl group $W$ is defined as the group generated by all these transformations.
    }
    \begin{property}[Weyl group symmetries]
        Every root $\phi\in\Phi$ can be written as $\phi = \sigma(\mu)$ for some $\mu\in\Delta$ and $\sigma\in W$. Furthermore, the root system $\Phi$ is closed under the action of $W$. In particular we can show that the Weyl group $W$ is precisely the symmetry group of the root system $\Phi$ and the isometry group of the Killing form (and its dual).
    \end{property}

    \newdef{Coroot}{\index{coroot}
        Consider the real span $\mathfrak{h}_0^*$ of the roots of $\mathfrak{g}$. Using the restriction of the (dual\footnote{Consider the \textit{sharp} map \ref{riemann:sharp_map} where the metric $g$ is given by the Killing form $K$. The dual Killing form $K^*$ is then a proper inner product (when restricted to the real span of $\Delta$) defined as
            \begin{gather}
                K^*(\cdot,\cdot) = K(\cdot^\sharp,\cdot^\sharp).
            \end{gather}
        }
        Killing form to this real subspace one can construct a dual space $\mathfrak{h}_0\subset\mathfrak{h}$. The coroot $\alpha^\vee\in\mathfrak{h}_0$ associated to a root $\alpha$ is then defined by the following formula (where we make use of the metric isomorphism $\mathfrak{h}_0\cong\mathfrak{h}_0^{**}$):
        \begin{gather}
            \alpha^\vee := 2\frac{\langle\alpha,\cdot\rangle}{\langle\alpha,\alpha\rangle}\equiv 2\frac{\alpha}{\langle\alpha,\alpha\rangle}.
        \end{gather}
        With this definition the Weyl transformations can be rewritten as follows:
        \begin{gather}
            \sigma_\lambda:\text{span}_{\mathbb{R}}(\Delta)\rightarrow\text{span}_{\mathbb{R}}(\Delta):\mu\mapsto \mu - \mu(\lambda^\vee)\lambda.
        \end{gather}
        In the remainder of this chapter we will often implicitly use this identification between $\mathfrak{h}_0$ and $\mathfrak{h}_0^*$.
    }
    \begin{notation}[Coroot]
        Sometimes it is more favourable to denote the coroot associated to $\alpha$ by $H^\alpha$. We will adopt this convention in the remainder of this chapter.
    \end{notation}

       \newdef{Weyl chamber}{\index{Weyl!chamber}\index{weight!dominant}
        Given a choice of positive roots $\Phi^+$, we define the closed (fundamental) Weyl chamber associated to this ordering as the subset $\mathcal{W}\subset\mathfrak{h}_0$ that contains the elements $w$ satisfying the following equation for all $\gamma\in\Phi^+$:
        \begin{gather}
            w(H^\gamma)\geq0.
        \end{gather}
        Elements of this Weyl chamber are called \textbf{dominant weights}.
    }
    \begin{property}[Weyl group]
        The Weyl group acts transitively on the set of Weyl chambers and accordingly on the orderings of the root system.
    \end{property}

    \begin{property}
        Let $\alpha\in\Phi$ be a root. Choose a generating element $E^\alpha$ of the weight space $\mathfrak{g}_\alpha$ associated to $\alpha$ and let $F^\alpha$ be the generator of the weight space $\mathfrak{g}_{-\alpha}$ such that $\text{span}\{E^\alpha,F^\alpha,[E^\alpha,F^\alpha]\}$ is a one-dimensional simple Lie algebra. Then the following relations hold (for $\beta\neq\pm\alpha$):
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $\beta(H^\alpha) = 2\frac{\langle\alpha, \beta\rangle}{\langle\alpha, \alpha\rangle}\in\mathbb{Z}$,
            \item $[H^\alpha,E^\alpha] = \alpha(H^\alpha)E^\alpha = 2E^\alpha$, and
            \item $[H^\alpha,F^\alpha] = -\alpha(H^\alpha)F^\alpha = -2F^\alpha$
        \end{itemize}
        where the inner product $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle$ is the dual Killing form.

    \newdef{Cartan matrix}{\index{Cartan!matrix}
        Let $\lambda_i,\lambda_j\in\Delta$ be simple roots. Because the Weyl group is the symmetry group of the root system \[\sigma_{\lambda_i}(\lambda_j) = \lambda_j - 2\frac{\langle\lambda_i,\lambda_j\rangle}{\langle\lambda_i,\lambda_i\rangle}\lambda_i\] is a root. From the properties above it then follows that the quantity
        \begin{gather}
            C_{ij} := 2\frac{\langle\lambda_i,\lambda_j\rangle}{\langle\lambda_i,\lambda_i\rangle} = \lambda_j(H^{\lambda_i})
        \end{gather}
        is an integer. The matrix formed by these numbers is called the Cartan matrix.
    }
    \begin{property}[Properties of Cartan matrix]\label{lie:cartan_prop}
        The Cartan matrix $C_{ij}$ is an integer-valued matrix with the following properties:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $C_{ii}=2$,
            \item $C_{ij}\leq0$ if $i\neq j$, and
            \item $C_{ij}=0\iff C_{ji}=0$.
        \end{itemize}
        This last property does not imply that the Cartan matrix is symmetric. The fact that it is not symmetric can immediately be seen from its definition. However, it is \textit{symmetrizable}, i.e. there exist a positive diagonal matrix $D$ and a symmetric matrix $S$ such that $C=DS$. Furthermore, the Cartan matrix is positive definite.
    \end{property}

    \newdef{Bond number}{\index{bond number}
        For all indices $i\neq j$ the bond number $n_{ij}$ is defined as follows:
        \begin{gather}
            n_{ij} := C_{ij}C_{ji}.
        \end{gather}
        Using the definition of the coefficients $C_{ij}$ we see that $n_{ij}$ is an integer equal to $4\cos^2\sphericalangle(\lambda_i,\lambda_j)$. This implies that $n_{ij}$ can only take on the values $0,1,2,3$. The value 4 would only be possible if the angle between $\lambda_i$ and $\lambda_j$ is 0, but this can only occur in the case where $i=j$ (which was excluded from the definition).
    }
    \begin{remark}
        In the case of $n_{ij} = 2$ or $n_{ij} = 3$ two possibilities arise: $C_{ij}>C_{ji}$ or $C_{ij}<C_{ji}$ for $i<j$. From the definition of the Cartan integers and the symmetry of the dual Killing form these cases correspond to $\langle\lambda_i,\lambda_i\rangle<\langle\lambda_j,\lambda_j\rangle$ and $\langle\lambda_i,\lambda_i\rangle>\langle\lambda_j,\lambda_j\rangle$.
    \end{remark}

    \begin{construct}[Dynkin diagram]\index{Dynkin diagram}\label{lie:construct_dynkin}
        For a semisimple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ with simple roots $\Delta$ we can draw a so-called Dynkin diagram by using the following rules:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item For every simple root $\lambda\in\Delta$ draw a circle $\bigcirc$.
            \item Draw $n_{ij}$ lines between the circles associated to $\lambda_i$ and $\lambda_j$.
            \item If $n_{ij}=2$ or 3, add a $<$ or $>$ sign based on the relation between their lengths (see previous remark).
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{construct}

    \begin{property}[Classification]
        The Dynkin diagrams can be classified as follows (for every type the first three examples are given):
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A$_n$: \begin{center}\dynk \dynkA{2} \dynkA{3} \end{center}
        \item B$_n, n\geq2$: \begin{center}\dynkB{2} \dynkB{3} \dynkB{4} \end{center}
        \item C$_n, n\geq2$: \begin{center}\dynkC{2} \dynkC{3} \dynkC{4} \end{center}
        \item D$_n, n\geq4$: \begin{center}\dynkD{4} \dynkD{5} \dynkD{6} \end{center}
        \end{itemize}
        These are the only possible diagrams for simple Lie algebras with exception of $E_6,E_7,E_8,F_4$ and $G_2$, the so-called \textit{exceptional Lie algebras}.
    \end{property}

    \begin{example}[Special linear group]
        By looking at the Lie brackets in equation \ref{lie:sl2c_lie_brackets} we see that the one-element set $\{X_1\}$ forms a Cartan subalgebra of $\mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb{C})$. From the same equation it is also immediately clear that the simple root set $\Delta$ is given by the one-element set $\{\lambda\in\mathfrak{sl}^*(2, \mathbb{C}): \lambda(X_1)\mapsto 2\}$. Hence the Dynkin diagram for $\mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb{C})$ is $A_1$.
    \end{example}

    \begin{theorem}[Cartan \& Killing]\index{Cartan-Killing}
        Every finite-dimensional simple Lie algebra (over $\mathbb{C}$) can be reconstructed from its set of simple roots $\Delta$.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{construct}[Chevalley-Serre]\index{Chevalley-Serre construction}\label{lie:reconstruction}
        Given a Dynkin diagram of a simple Lie algebra we can reconstruct the original Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ (over $\mathbb{C})$ up to isomorphism:

        \qquad The number of nodes is equal to the number of simple roots and hence gives us the rank of $\mathfrak{g}$. Let us denote this rank by $n$. We first construct the free Lie algebra on $3n$ generators $\{E_i,F_i,H_i\}_{i\leq n}$. The Cartan subalgebra $\mathfrak{h}\leq\mathfrak{g}$ is constructed from the generators $H_i$ by imposing the following relations:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $[H_i,H_j] = 0$,
            \item $[H_i,E_j] = a_{ij}E_j$,
            \item $[H_i,F_j] = -a_{ij}F_j$, and
            \item $[E_i,F_j] = \delta_{ij}H_j$
        \end{itemize}
        where the numbers $a_{ij}$ form the Cartan matrix obtained by reversing construction \ref{lie:construct_dynkin}. To complete the reconstruction one imposes the following additional relations:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $\text{ad}_{E_i}^{|a_{ij}|+1}(E_j) = 0$, and
            \item $\text{ad}_{F_i}^{|a_{ij}|+1}(F_j) = 0$.
        \end{itemize}
        The first set of relations are called the \textbf{Chevalley relations} and the last two are called the \textbf{Serre relations}. The full construction is called the \textbf{Chevalley-Serre presentation}.
    \end{construct}

        An element $H\in\mathfrak{h}_0$ is said to be algebraically integral if its value on every root is an integer. The set of all algebraically integral elements is called the \textbf{weight lattice}.

    \newdef{Fundamental weight}{\index{weight!fundalental}
        Let $\Delta=\{\alpha_i\}_{i\leq\rk(\mathfrak{g})}$ be the set of simple roots. The fundamental weights $\{\omega_i\}_{i\leq\rk(\mathfrak{g})}$ are defined as the elements of $\mathfrak{h}_0^*$ for which the following formula is satisfied for all $i,j\leq|\Delta|$:
        \begin{gather}
            \omega_i(H^{\alpha_j})=\delta_{ij}.
        \end{gather}
        This implies that an element $\lambda\in\mathfrak{h}_0$ is algebraically integral if it is an integral combination of fundamental weights.

        Let $\Phi^+$ be a choice of positive roots. We can define a partial ordering on the set of weights $\mathfrak{h}^*_0$ in the following way:

    }

    \begin{theorem}[Highest weight theorem]
        Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a finite-dimensional Lie algebra. The following statements hold:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Every finite-dimensional irreducible representation of $\mathfrak{g}$ has a unique dominant integral highest weight.
            \item If two irreducible representations have the same highest weight, then they are isomorphic.
            \item Every dominant integral weight is the highest weight of an irreducible finite-dimensional representation.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{theorem}

\subsection{\difficult{Kac-Moody algebras}}

    \begin{construct}[Kac-Moody algebra]\index{Kac-Moody algebra}\index{Cartan!matrix}\label{lie:kac_moody}
        Consider the Cartan matrix $A$ associated to a finite-dimensional (semi)simple Lie algebra. This matrix has the properties listed in \ref{lie:cartan_prop}. If we only retain the first three points from \ref{lie:cartan_prop}, we obtain a \textbf{generalized Cartan matrix}. For such a generalized Cartan matrix we can construct a (possibly infinite-dimensional) Lie algebra using an analogue of the Chevalley-Serre relations.

        Since a generalized Cartan matrix might have $\det(A)=0$ we cannot use the Chevalley-Serre presentation as given in construction \ref{lie:reconstruction}, because the constructed roots might be linearly dependent. However, this problem can be easily solved:

        \qquad Let $A$ be an $n\times n$ (generalized) Cartan matrix. First we construct a complex vector space $\mathfrak{h}$ of dimension $2n-\rk(A)$ and choose for every $i\leq n$ a simple root $\alpha_i$ (resp. coroot $H^{\alpha_i}$) in $\mathfrak{h}^*$ (resp. $\mathfrak{h}$) such that these are linearly independent and satisfy the condition $\alpha_i(H^{\alpha_j})=A_{ij}$. (Such a choice is always possible and it is unique up to isomorphism.) Then we construct the free Lie algebra $\widetilde{\mathfrak{g}}$ on $4n-\rk(A)$ generators $\{E_i, F_i\}_{i\leq n}\cup\mathfrak{h}$ and quotient out the following relations:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $[E_i,F_j] = \delta_{ij}H^{\alpha_i}$,
            \item $[H,H']=0$ for $H,H'\in\mathfrak{h}$,
            \item $[H,E_i]=\alpha_i(H)E_i$ for $H\in\mathfrak{h}$, and
            \item $[H,F_i]=-\alpha_i(H)F_i$ for $H\in\mathfrak{h}$.
        \end{itemize}
        Given this Lie algebra we can find the unique maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}\leq\widetilde{\mathfrak{g}}$ for which $\mathfrak{m}\cap\mathfrak{h}=\{0\}$. The quotient algebra $\widetilde{\mathfrak{g}}/\mathfrak{m}$ is called the Kac-Moody algebra associated to $A$.\footnote{\textit{Kac} proved that for symmetrizable $A$ this construction is equivalent to the Chevalley-Serre presentation with the generators as given here.} Although we did not add an analogue of the Serre relations in the construction it can be shown that these still hold (see for example \cite{aminiinfinite}).
    \end{construct}
    \begin{remark}
        Assume that the generalized Cartan matrix $A$ is still symmetrizable. Then there exist three distinct classes of Kac-Moody algebras (based on the definiteness of $A$):
        \begin{itemize}
            \item If $A$ is positive definite, then we obtain a finite-dimensional (semi)simple Lie algebra.
            \item If $A$ is positive semi-definite, then we obtain a Kac-Moody algebra of \textbf{affine type}. In fact, it can be shown for generalized Cartan matrices $A$ that affinity is equivalent to the existence of a unique (up to scaling) real vector $v$ such that $Av=0$.
            \item If $A$ is indefinite, then we obtain a Kac-Moody of \textbf{indefinite type}.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{remark}

    \begin{construct}[Loop algebra]\index{loop!algebra}
        Consider a finite-dimensional Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. From this Lie algebra we can construct the so-called \textbf{loop algebra} $L\mathfrak{g}$. The underlying vector space is given by $\mathfrak{g}\otimes\mathbb{C}[t,t^{-1}]$ and the Lie bracket is given by $[g\otimes t^k,g'\otimes t^l] = [g,g']_{\mathfrak{g}}\otimes t^{k+l}$ (extended by linearity to the full vector space). For this reason the loop algebra is sometimes denoted by $\mathfrak{g}[t,t^{-1}]$.

        Equivalently, we can obtain the loop algebra as the space of polynomial maps from $S^1$ to $\mathfrak{g}$ (hence the name). Furthermore, if $G$ is the Lie group associated to $\mathfrak{g}$ and $LG$ denotes its (free) loop group \ref{topology:loop_group}, then $LG$ has the natural structure of a (infinite-dimensional) Lie group and its Lie algebra is precisely $L\mathfrak{g}$.
    \end{construct}

    \begin{construct}[Affine Lie algebra]\index{affine!algebra}
        Given a simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ we construct the affine Lie algebra $\widehat{\mathfrak{g}}$ as the central extension of the loop algebra $L\mathfrak{g}$ by $\mathbb{C}$ associated to the cocycle \[\Theta:(g\otimes t^k,g'\otimes t^l)\mapsto kK(g,g')\delta_{k+l,0}\] where $K(\cdot,\cdot)$ is the Killing form on $\mathfrak{g}$. The generator $c$ of the extending vector space is often called the \textbf{central element} (since it is mapped to an element in the center of $\widehat{\mathfrak{g}}$). This cocycle can also be defined using the residue \ref{complexcalculus:residue_def} of a Laurent polynomial:
        \begin{gather}
            \Theta(f,g) := \text{Res}\left[K(f,g)\right]_t
        \end{gather}
        where we extended the Killing form on $\mathfrak{g}$ to $L\mathfrak{g}$ by $K(a\otimes t^k,b\otimes t^l)=K(a,b)t^{k+l}$.

        However, to obtain a well-behaved affine Kac-Moody algebra we also need to extend this affine Lie algebra by a derivation. First we observe that the loop algebra, and accordingly, the affine Lie algebra is $\mathbb{Z}$-graded. A well-defined derivation is then obtained through multiplication by the grading. To this intent we add a formal generator $d$ together with the following relations (the central element from the previous step will be denoted by $c$):
        \begin{align}
            [d,g\otimes P(t)] &= g\otimes t\deriv{}{t}P(t)\\
            [d,c] &= 0
        \end{align}
        where $P(t)\in\mathbb{C}[t,t^{-1}]$.
    \end{construct}
    \newdef{Twisted Kac-Moody algebra}{\index{Kac-Moody algebra}
        Given a simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ with associated Cartan matrix $A$ we can construct an affine Cartan matrix $\widehat{A}$, called the \textit{extended} Cartan matrix. It can then be shown that the affine Kac-Moody algebra associated to $\widehat{A}$, as defined in \ref{lie:kac_moody}, is isomorphic to the affine Kac-Moody algebra as constructed above starting from the simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$.

        All affine Kac-Moody algebras that are isomorphic to Lie algebras defined in this way are said to be \textbf{untwisted}. All other affine Kac-Moody algebras are said to be \textbf{twisted}.

The universal enveloping algebra $U(\mathfrak{g})$ is defined as the quotient of $T(\mathfrak{g})$ by the two-sided ideal generated by the elements $g\otimes h - h\otimes g - [g,h]$, where $g,h$ range over $\mathfrak{g}$.
    }

    \begin{construct}\label{lie:uea_construct}
        If we regard the Chevalley-Serre presentation from construction \ref{lie:reconstruction} as a presentation for a unital associative algebra instead of as a Lie algebra presentation (by replacing the Lie bracket by the commutator constructed from the algebra multiplication) we obtain the universal enveloping algebra $U(\mathfrak{g})$ of $\mathfrak{g}$.

    \begin{theorem}[Poincar\'e-Birkhoff-Witt]\index{Poincar\'e-Birkhoff-Witt}

    }
    \newformula{Quadratic Casimir invariant}{
        Consider a Lie algebra representation $\rho:\mathfrak{g}\rightarrow\text{End}(V)$ on a vector space $V$ and let $\{X_i\}_{i\leq\dim(\mathfrak{g})}$ be a basis for $\mathfrak{g}$. The (quadratic) Casimir invariant associated with $\rho$ is given by
        \begin{gather}
            \Omega_\rho := \sum_{i=0}^{\dim(\mathfrak{g})}\rho(X_i)\circ\rho(\xi_i)
        \end{gather}
        where the set $\{\xi_i\}_{i\leq n}$ is defined by the relation $K_\rho(X_i,\xi_j)=\delta_{ij}$ using the Killing form \ref{lie:rho_killing_form}.
    }
    \begin{property}[Casimir invariants of irreducible representations]
        When the representation $\rho:\mathfrak{g}\rightarrow\text{End}(V)$ is irreducible, Schur's lemma \ref{rep:schurs_lemma} tells us that
        \begin{gather}
            \Omega_\rho = c_\rho\mathbbm{1}_V.
        \end{gather}
        By taking the trace of this formula and using formula \ref{lie:rho_killing_form} we see that $c_\rho = \frac{\dim\mathfrak{g}}{\dim V}$.
    \end{property}

    \newdef{Verma module}{\index{Verma module}\label{lie:verma_module}
        Consider a finite-dimensional Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ with Borel subalgebra $\mathfrak{b}$. The Verma module with highest weight $\lambda$ is defined as follows\footnote{This can be seen as an "extension of scalars" procedure where we turn a $U(\mathfrak{b})$-module in a $U(\mathfrak{g})$-module.}:
        \begin{gather}
            V(\lambda) := U(\mathfrak{g})\otimes_{U(\mathfrak{b})}\mathbb{C}_\lambda
        \end{gather}
        where $\mathbb{C}_\lambda$ is the one-dimensional left $\mathfrak{b}$-module where the Cartan subalgebra acts by weight $\lambda$ and $\mathfrak{n}_+\subset\mathfrak{b}$ acts trivially. $U(\mathfrak{g})$ contains $U(\mathfrak{b})$ as a subalgebra by the PBW theorem and hence is a right $U(\mathfrak{b})$-module through right multiplication. Since $U(\mathfrak{g})$ is trivially a left module over itself, the Verma module also becomes a left $U(\mathfrak{g})$-module.
    }
    The Verma module with highest weight $\lambda$ can also be defined using a quotient construction:
    \begin{adefinition}
        Let $I_\lambda\subset U(\mathfrak{g})$ be the left ideal generated by the following elements (these relations precisely give the conditions for a highest weight vector):
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $X_\alpha\in\mathfrak{g_\alpha}$ for all positive roots $\alpha$, and
            \item $H-\lambda(H)\mathbf{1}$ for all $H\in\mathfrak{h}$.
        \end{itemize}
        The Verma module $V(\lambda)$ is then defined as the quotient $U(\mathfrak{g})/I_\lambda$.
    \end{adefinition}

    The importance of Verma modules is given by the following property:
    \begin{property}[Highest weight modules]
        The Verma module $V(\lambda)$ is a highest weight module with highest weight vector $\mathbf{1}\otimes\mathbf{1}$ (here we used the first definition of Verma modules). Furthermore, every highest weight module with highest weight $\lambda$ is a quotient of the Verma module $V(\lambda)$.
    \end{property}

    \begin{property}[Basis of Verma module]
         A basis for $V(\lambda)$ is given by the monomials $F_{\alpha_1}^{m_1}F_{\alpha_2}^{m_2}\cdots F_{\alpha_N}^{m_N}v_\lambda$ where $v_\lambda$ is the highest weight vector, $\alpha_i$ are negative roots, $m_i\in\mathbb{N}$ and $F_{\alpha_i}\in\mathfrak{g}_{\alpha_i}$.
    \end{property}

\subsection{Group contractions}

    \newdef{In\"on\"u-Wigner contraction}{\index{In\"on\"u-Wigner}\label{lie:inonu_wigner}
        Consider an $n$-dimensional Lie group $G$ with Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. Choose a basis $\{e_i\}_{i\leq n}$ for $\mathfrak{g}$. A nonsingular transformation of the basis would leave the structure of the group unchanged. However, we can rewrite this nonsingular transformation in terms of a singular transformation: \[U = u + \varepsilon w.\] The group contraction is obtained by taking the limit $\varepsilon\rightarrow0$. In terms of the structure constants this is equivalent to setting some of the structure constants to zero thereby obtaining a subalgebra (and its associated subgroup). It can be shown that there exists a bijection between continuous subgroups and group contractions. The Lie algebra elements belonging to the contracted subalgebra form an Abelian invariant subalgebra and hence generate an Abelian invariant subgroup. The group contraction $\widetilde{G}$ is obtained as the quotient group of $G$ with respect to this Abelian subgroup.
    }

    \begin{example}[Galilei group]
        The Galilei group in $d$ dimensions can be obtained as a group contraction of the inhomogeneous Lorentz group in $d+1$ (spacetime) dimensions with respect to time displacements and spatial rotations.
    \end{example}

\subsection{\difficult{Lie algebra cohomology}}\index{cohomology!Lie algebra}\label{section:lie_algebra_cohomology}

    Although the following construction can be generalized almost identically to the infinite-dimensional case, we only state it for finite dimensions:
    \newdef{Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra}{\index{Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra}
        Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a finite-dimensional Lie algebra. Consider a basis $\{t_a\}_{a\leq n}$ of $\mathfrak{g}$ and let $\{t^a\}_{a\leq n}$ be its linear dual. The Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra $\text{CE}(\mathfrak{g})$ is defined the Grassmann algebra $\Lambda^\bullet\mathfrak{g}^*$ with a dg-algebra structure induced by the differential\footnote{In section \ref{section:bv_formalism} we explain how this differential is obtained as the dual of the Lie bracket.}
        \begin{gather}
            dt^a:=-\frac{1}{2}c_{bc}^{\ \ a}t^b\wedge t^c
        \end{gather}
        where $c_{bc}^{\ \ a}$ are the structure constants of $\mathfrak{g}$.
    }

    By analogy to the case of group (co)homology we define the (co)homology of a Lie algebra using the Tor en Ext functors associated to a certain category of rings and modules. The natural choice of ring in the case of Lie algebras is the universal enveloping algebra $U(\mathfrak{g})$. The tensor and Hom operations underlying the construction are defined with respect to the trivial $U(\mathfrak{g})$-module $k$ (the underlying field of the Lie algebra). This gives:
    \begin{align}
        H^i_{\text{Lie}}(k;M) &:= \text{Ext}^i_{U(\mathfrak{g})}(k,M)\\
        H_i^{\text{Lie}}(k;M) &:= \text{Tor}_i^{U(\mathfrak{g})}(k,M)
    \end{align}
    where $M$ is a $\mathfrak{g}$-module and, by extension, also a $U(\mathfrak{g})$-module.

    For the remainder of this section we will focus on cohomology. The chapter on homological algebra (see section \ref{section:tor_ext}) tells us that we have to find a projective resolution of $k$ to determine the Ext-functor in terms of hom-sets $\text{Hom}(\mathcal{F}, M)$. It can be shown that the relevant object is given by the tensor product $U(\mathfrak{g})\otimes\Lambda^\bullet\mathfrak{g}$:
    \begin{gather}
        \text{Ext}^i_{U(\mathfrak{g})}(k, M) = H^i(\text{Hom}_{\mathfrak{g}}(U(\mathfrak{g)}\otimes_k\Lambda^\bullet\mathfrak{g}, M)) \cong H^i(\text{Hom}_k(\Lambda^\bullet\mathfrak{g}, M))
    \end{gather}
    where the differential of the (middle) complex is given by
    \begin{gather}
        d(u\otimes g_1\wedge\cdots\wedge g_n) := \sum_i(-1)^{i+1}ug_i\otimes(g_1\wedge\cdots\wedge\hat{g}_i\wedge\cdots\wedge g_n)\\+ \sum_{i<j}(-1)^{i+j}u\otimes[g_i,g_j]\wedge\cdots\wedge\hat{g}_i\wedge\cdots\wedge\hat{g}_j\wedge\cdots\wedge g_n.\nonumber
    \end{gather}
    In the case $M=k$ the Hom-complex can easily be seen to be the Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra $\text{CE}(\mathfrak{g})=\Lambda^\bullet\mathfrak{g}^*$ (this last equality is only valid for finite-dimensional algebras). Using a change of coefficients the general case is shown to be isomorphic to $M\otimes\Lambda^\bullet\mathfrak{g}^*$ where the differential on $\Lambda^\bullet\mathfrak{g}^*$ gets extended by the extra term $(-1)^n dm\otimes\omega$ with $dm(g):=g\cdot m$.

    \newdef{Weil algebra}{\index{Weil!algebra}
        Consider a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. Its Weil algebra is defined as the dg-algebra $\Lambda^\bullet(\mathfrak{g}^*\oplus\mathfrak{g}^*[1])$ with diferential $d_W:=d_{\text{CE}}+\mathbf{d}$ where $d_{\text{CE}}$ is the differential on the Chevalley-Eilenberg subalgebra $\text{CE}(\mathfrak{g})\subset W(\mathfrak{g})$ and $\mathbf{d}$ shifts the degree of $\mathfrak{g}^*$ by $1$ and acts as 0 on $\mathfrak{g}^*[1]$. The action of $d_{\text{CE}}$ on shifted generators is defined through the relation $[\mathbf{d},d_{\text{CE}}]=0$.
    }
    \newdef{Horizontal elements}{\index{horizontal!elements}
        The elements of the subalgebra $\Lambda^\bullet\mathfrak{g}^*[1]$ are sometimes called the horizontal elements.
    }

    From here one we shall drop the subscript and denote the differential of the Weil algebra by $d$. It is clear that we have a short exact sequence
    \begin{gather}
        \label{lie:weil_algebra_sequence}
        0\rightarrow\ker(p)\rightarrow W(\mathfrak{g})\overset{p}{\twoheadrightarrow}\text{CE}(\mathfrak{g})\rightarrow0
    \end{gather}
    where $p$ is the obvious projection map. An important subset of $\mathfrak{h}$ is given by the algebra of invariant polynomials inv$(\mathfrak{g})$:
    \newdef{Invariant polynomial}{\index{invariant!polynomial}
        A horizontal element $\omega$ for which $d\omega$ is also horizontal. (Sometimes one replaces the horizontality condition by $d\omega=0$.)
    }
    It should be noted that although this definition might seem complicated, it is (for ordinary Lie algebras\footnote{The above definition leads to an easy generalization in the context of $L_\infty$-algebras.}) equivalent to the ordinary definition in terms of $ad$-invariant polynomials:
    \newadef{Invariant polynomial}{\index{invariant!polynomial}
        Let $G$ be a Lie group with Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. A polynomial $P\in k[\mathfrak{g}]$, where $k$ is the base field, is said to be invariant (or sometimes $\text{Ad}$-invariant) if
        \begin{gather}
            P(X) = P(gXg^{-1})
        \end{gather}
        for all $X\in\mathfrak{g}$ and $g\in G$. This subalgebra of $k[\mathfrak{g}]$ is denoted by $k[\mathfrak{g}]^G$.
    }

    A concept that will be important later on in the study of characteristic classes on fibre bundles is the transgression map:
    \newdef{Transgression}{\index{transgression}
        The exact sequence \ref{lie:weil_algebra_sequence} induces a long exact sequence in cohomology. An invariant polynomial is said to be in transgression with a cocycle in $\text{CE}(\mathfrak{g})$ if their cohomology classes are related by the connecting morphism. More explicitly, by definition of invariant polynomials we have $d\omega = 0$ and since $W(\mathfrak{g})$ has vanishing cohomology, there exists an element $c_\omega$ such that $\omega=dc_\omega$. By restricting $c_\omega$ to $\text{CE}(\mathfrak{g})$ we obtain a $\mathfrak{g}$-cocycle since $d_{\text{CE}}c_\omega=0$.
    }
    \begin{example}[Killing form]\label{lie:killing_transgression}
        Consider the invariant polynomial $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle$ induced by the Killing form on a semisimple Lie algebra. By transgression one obtains the canonical 3-cocycle $\langle\cdot, [\cdot,\cdot]\rangle$.
    \end{example}

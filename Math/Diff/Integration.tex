\subsection{Orientation and densities}

    One can define an orientation of manifolds by generalizing the situation for vector spaces \ref{vector:orientation}:
    \newdef{Orientable manifold}{\index{orientation}\index{orientable!manifold}\index{volume!form}\label{bundle:orientability}
        First, the definition of the volume element needs to be slightly modified. A \textbf{volume form} on $M$ is a nowhere-vanishing top-dimensional differential form $\vol\in\Omega^{\dim(M)}(M)$. The definition of an orientation is now virtually the same as for vector spaces.

        An \textbf{oriented atlas} is given by all charts of $M$ for which the pullback of the Euclidean volume form is a positive multiple of $\vol$. This also implies that the transition functions have a positive Jacobian determinant. The existence of such a volume form turns a differentiable manifold into an \textbf{orientable manifold}.

        Alternatively, an (orientable) manifold with volume form $\vol$ is said to be \textbf{positively oriented} if it comes equipped with a smooth choice of bases $\{v_1,\ldots,v_n\}$ for $T_pM$ such that
        \begin{gather}
            \vol_p(v_1,\ldots,v_n)>0.
        \end{gather}
    }

    \begin{example}\index{determinant}
        Let $M=\mathbb{R}^n$. The canonical Euclidean volume form is given by the determinant map
        \begin{gather}
            \det:(u_1,\ldots,u_n)\mapsto\det(u_1,\ldots,u_n),
        \end{gather}
        where the $u_n$'s are expressed in the canonical basis $(e_1,\ldots,e_n)$. The terminology of ``volume forms'' is justified by noting that the determinant map gives the signed volume of the $n$-dimensional parallelotope spanned by the vectors $\{u_1,\ldots,u_n\}$.
    \end{example}

    \begin{property}
        Let $\omega_1,\omega_2$ be two volume forms on $M$. Because the space of top-degree forms is one-dimensional, there exists a smooth function $f$ such that \[\omega_1 = f\omega_2.\] Furthermore, the sign of this function is constant on every connected component of $M$.
    \end{property}

    One can also rephrase orientability of manifolds in terms of bundles:
    \newdef{Orientation bundle}{\index{orientation}\label{bundle:orientation_bundle}
        Consider a manifold $M$. The transition function $A$ of $TM$ is given by the Jacobian of the transitions functions on $M$. The associated line bundle with transition function $\sgn\det(A)$ is called the orientation bundle $o(M)$.

        In general one can define the orientation bundle $o(E)$ for any vector bundle $E$, where one replaces the Jacobian in the above construction by the transition maps of $E$. From this it is clear that the orientation bundle $o(M)$ is the same as $o(TM)$.
    }
    \newadef{Orientable manifold}{
        A manifold is orientable if its orientation bundle is trivial.
    }

    \begin{remark}
        By definition of the orientation bundle, the transition functions are those that have a positive determinant. This gives the equivalence with Definition \ref{bundle:orientability}. In the next chapter on principal bundles yet another (equivalent) definition of orientability in terms of $G$-structures will be given (see Example \ref{bundle:orientable_structure}).
    \end{remark}

    Further below, integration theory will be generalized from orientable manifolds to non-orientable manifolds. To achieve this goal the notion of differential forms needs to be generalized. A good introduction for this is \cite{tensor_bundle_calculus}.
    \newdef{Pseudoscalars}{\index{pseudo-!scalar}
        Let $G$ be a Lie group and consider a group morphism $\phi:G\rightarrow\mathrm{O}(p,q)$ for some $p,q\in\mathbb{N}$. The pseudoscalar representation of $G$, induced by $\phi$, is defined as the one-dimensional representation given by
        \begin{gather}
            \mathbf{1}_{\sgn}:g\mapsto\det(\phi(g)).
        \end{gather}
        The notation $\mathbf{1}_{\sgn}$ refers to the fact that this is a generalization of the \textit{alternating} (or \textit{sign}) \textit{representation} of the permutation groups $S_n$. Any Riemannian manifold admits a canonical pseudoscalar bundle $\Psi$ associated to its (orthogonal) frame bundle.

        Sections of a vector bundle with transition functions defined by $\mathbf{1}_{\sgn}$ are generally called \textbf{pseudoscalar fields}. When using the pseudoscalar representation of the transition functions of the tangent bundle $TM$ to construct an associated bundle, one obtains the pseudoscalar bundle $\Psi_M$. A vector bundle twisted by the pseudoscalar bundle $\Psi$ often receives the prefix ``pseudo'', e.g. the $\Psi$-twisted $k$-form bundle is called the bundle of $k$-\textbf{pseudoforms}.
    }

    \begin{definition}[Tensor density]\index{tensor!density}\label{bundle:density}
        Consider a vector bundle $E\rightarrow M$ defined by transition functions $A$. The associated bundle of (tensor) $s$-densities is obtained by using the representation
        \begin{gather}
            \rho:A\mapsto\det(A)^{-s}.
        \end{gather}
        The number $s$ is called the \textbf{weight} of the density. For $E\equiv TM$ one obtains the (tensor) $s$-densities on $M$, which in the case of $s=1$ are equivalent to top-dimensional forms on $M$. When twisting a vector bundle by an $s$-density bundle, the prefix ``$s$-weighted'' is often added.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{example}[Pseudovectors]\index{pseudo-!vector}
        The representation
        \begin{gather}
            \rho:A\mapsto\sgn\det(A)A
        \end{gather}
        gives rise to a bundle similar to the tangent bundle, where the sign of the cocycles $t_{ji}$ now has an influence on the fibres. Sections of such bundles are called \textbf{pseudovector fields}. This construction is equivalent to twisting the tangent bundle by the pseudoscalar bundle $\Psi$ (hence its name).
    \end{example}

    \begin{remark}[Honest densities]\index{density}\label{bundle:honest_density}
        One should pay incredible attention to the definition of a \textbf{density} (i.e. without the prefix ``tensor''). A density is defined as an $n$-pseudoform, i.e. a section of the \textbf{density bundle} $|\Omega|(M):=\Omega^n(M)\otimes o(M)$. Here, the transition function is $|\det(A)|$, where $A$ is the transition function of $T^*M$. These are the objects one can integrate over any manifold, even the non-orientable ones. They are essentially maps $\Gamma(\det(T^*M))\rightarrow C^\infty(M)$. A naive way to construct a density on a manifold $M$ is by choosing a volume form $\vol(M)$ and taking the absolute value $|\vol(M)|$.

        One can also define \textbf{honest $s$-densities} $|\Omega|^s(M)$ by combining Definition \ref{bundle:density} with the orientation bundle to obtain transition maps $|\det(A)|^s$, where $A$ is again the cotangent transition function. This is also the only possible way to generalize the (tensor) $s$-densities to real $s$.
    \end{remark}
    \begin{property}[Orientability]
        A smooth manifold is orientable if and only if its canonical line bundle \ref{bundle:canonical_bundle} is trivial. Furthermore, for orientable manifolds there exists an isomorphism $\Gamma(\det(T^*M))\cong\Gamma(|\Omega|(M))$.
    \end{property}

\subsection{Orientation in homology}

    In this section a characterization of orientability in terms of the homology of a manifold is given. Smoothness is not required here. See Sections \ref{section:homology} and \ref{section:singular_homology} for an introduction to homology.

    Begin with the canonical example $\mathbb{R}^n$. Intuitively one would expect an orientation on Euclidean space to be a property that is preserved under rotations and reversed by reflections. On the sphere these operations have degree $1$ and $-1$ respectively, so the perfect choice for an orientation would be the generator of $H_n(S^n)\cong\mathbb{Z}$. Luckily, there exists an isomorphism $H_n(S^n)\cong H_n(\mathbb{R}^n,\mathbb{R}^n\backslash\{\ast\})$. So, for every point $x\in\mathbb{R}^n$ one can define a local orientation as a choice of generator of the local homology group $H_n(\mathbb{R}^n,\mathbb{R}^n\backslash\{x\})$.

    For a given manifold $M$ one then defines a global orientation (if it exists) as a choice of local orientation for every point $p\in M$ such that every two points admitting a common covering chart have consistent local orientations.

    \begin{property}[Orientability]\index{fundamental!class}\index{orientation!class}\label{bundle:orientation_class}
        If a closed connected manifold is ($\mathbb{Z}\,$-)orientable, there exists an isomorphism
        \begin{gather}
            H_n(M)\cong H_n(M,M\backslash\{p\})
        \end{gather}
        for all points $p\in M$. A choice of class in $H_n(M)$ that maps to a generator of $H_n(M,M\backslash\{p\})$ for all $p\in M$ is called a \textbf{fundamental class} or \textbf{orientation class}.

        In the case where $M$ is not connected, the fundamental class equals the direct sum of the generators of the connected components (following the idea of the additivity axiom \ref{topology:eilenberg_steenrod_axioms}).
    \end{property}
    The above definition and property can be generalized to arbitrary unital rings $R$:
    \newdef{$R$-orientability}{\index{orientable!manifold}
        A manifold is $M$-orientable if a consistent choice of local $R$-orientation exists or, equivalently, if $H_n(M;R)\cong R$.
    }

    \begin{property}[Non-orientable manifolds]
        If $M$ is not $R$-orientable, the map \[H_n(M;R)\rightarrow H_n(M,M\backslash\{p\};R)\] is still injective with image $\{r\in R\mid 2r=0\}$. In particular, every closed manifold is $\mathbb{Z}_2$-orientable.
    \end{property}

    \begin{property}[Orientability implies $R$-orientability]
        By the \textit{universal coefficient theorem} it follows that a $\mathbb{Z}$-orientable manifold is also $R$-orientable for all unital rings $R$. Conversely, a manifold is $\mathbb{Z}$-orientable if it is $R$-orientable for all unital rings $R$.
    \end{property}

\subsection{Integration of top-dimensional forms}\index{Lebesgue!integral}\index{measure}

    \newdef{Measure zero}{\index{null!set}
        A subset $U\subset M$ of an orientable manifold is said to be of measure zero (or \textbf{null}) if it is the countable union of inverse images (with respect to the chart maps on $M$) of null sets in $\mathbb{R}^n$.
    }

    \newdef{Integrable form}{\index{integrable}
        A differential form for which its components with respect to any basis of $\Omega^k(M)$ are Lebesgue integrable on $\mathbb{R}^n$.
    }

    \begin{formula}[Integration with compact support]
        Consider a top-dimensional form $\omega\in\Omega^{\dim(M)}$ on $M$ with compact support on a coordinate patch $U\subset M$.
        \begin{gather}
            \label{bundle:integration_compact_support}
            \int_M\omega = \int_U\omega := \int_{-\infty}^\infty\cdots\int_{-\infty}^\infty\omega_{12\ldots n}(x)dx^1dx^2\cdots dx^n.
        \end{gather}
        This integral is well-defined because under an orientation-preserving change of coordinates the component $\omega_{1\ldots n}$ transforms as $\omega'_{1\ldots n} = \det(J)\omega_{1\ldots n}$, where $J$ is the Jacobian of the coordinate transformation. Inserting this in the integral and replacing $dx_i$ by $dx'_i$ then gives the well-known change-of-variables formula from (Lebesgue) integration theory.

        If one requires the manifold $M$ to be paracompact, such that every open cover $\{U_i\subseteq M\}_{i\in I}$ admits a subordinate partition of unity $\{\phi_i\}_{i\in I}$, one can define the integral of a general compactly supported form $\omega\in\Omega^n(M)$ as follows:
        \begin{gather}
            \int_M\omega := \sum_{i\in I}\int_{U_i}\rho_i\omega.
        \end{gather}
    \end{formula}
    \begin{remark}
        Although integration was only defined for compactly supported forms, the general formula can also be applied to general forms. It is well-defined whenever the forms $\rho_i\omega$ are integrable and the sum in the definition converges.
    \end{remark}

    \newprop{Compact manifolds}{
        Let $M$ be a smooth compact manifold. Because every form on $M$ is automatically compactly supported, all forms are integrable on $M$.
    }

    \newprop{Invariance under pullbacks}{
        Consider an orientation-preserving diffeomorphism $f:M\rightarrow N$.
        \begin{gather}
            \int_Mf^*\omega = \int_N\omega
        \end{gather}
    }

    \begin{notation}
        Because the integral of differential forms is linear in the integrand and additive over disjoint unions, it can be interpreted as a linear pairing. This motivates the following notation:
        \begin{gather}
            \langle M,\omega \rangle := \int_M\omega.
        \end{gather}
    \end{notation}

\subsection{Stokes's theorem}

    \begin{theorem}[Stokes's theorem]\index{Stokes}\label{bundle:stokes_theorem}
        Let $M$ be an orientable manifold with boundary $\partial M$ and let $\omega$ be a differential $k$-form on $M$.
        \begin{gather}
            \int_{\partial M}\omega = \int_M d\omega.
        \end{gather}
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{result}
        The Kelvin-Stokes theorem \ref{vector:kelvin_stokes_theorem}, the divergence theorem \ref{vector:divergence_theorem} and Green's identity \ref{vector:green_indentity} are immediate results of this (generalized) Stokes's theorem.
    \end{result}

    \newdef{Calibration}{\index{calibration}
        A degree-$p$ calibration on a smooth manifold $M$ with volume form $\mathrm{Vol}$ is a differential form $\omega\in\Omega^p(M)$ satisfying the following conditions:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item\textbf{Closedness}: $d\omega=0$.
            \item\textbf{Volume}: Over any dimension-$p$ submanifold, the integral of $\omega$ is smaller than its volume, with at least one submanifold saturating the inequality.
        \end{enumerate}
        A submanifold is said to be \textbf{calibrated} if the restriction of the calibration to this submanifold coincides with the induced volume form.
    }
    \begin{property}
        Calibrated submanifolds minimize the volume within their homology class.
    \end{property}

\subsection{\difficult{Distributions}}\index{distribution}

    For more information on the theory of distributions on Euclidean space, see Chapter \ref{chapter:distributions}.

    There are two ways to introduce distributions on general manifolds. Either one uses the locally Euclidean character, defines distributions on charts and glues them together using some compatibility data (see for example \cite{AMP1}) or one defines them as the dual of the space of smooth functions (with compact support) as in the Euclidean case. In this section the second approach is followed.

    The base manifold $M$ will be required to be paracompact and second-countable. Moreover, it is assumed that a Riemannian metric $g$ is given (see Chapter \ref{chapter:riemann}). This data allows to turn the space of smooth sections of any tensor bundle over $M$ into a Fr\'echet space \ref{functional:frechet_space} using a generalization of the seminorms \eqref{distribution:D_seminorm}, where the (partial) derivatives $\partial_i$ are replaced by covariant derivatives $\nabla_i$. The norm will now also be the one induced (fibrewise) by $g$. In a similar way one can for every compact subset $K\subset M$ define the space $\mathcal{D}(K,\otimes^p)$ of smooth $p$-tensor fields with support in $K$. By taking the direct limit (with its associated topology) one obtains the space of smooth compactly supported $p$-tensor fields $\mathcal{D}(M,\otimes^p)$.

    \newdef{Tensor distribution}{\index{distribution!tensor}
        The space of tensor distributions of order $p$ is defined as the continuous dual of $\mathcal{D}(M,\otimes^p)$.
    }

    Much of the theory of distributions on Euclidean space can be generalized to smooth manifolds without too much trouble (for example one again obtains a dense inclusion $\mathcal{D}\hookrightarrow\mathcal{D}'$). An interesting generalization is the definition of the covariant derivative:
    \newdef{Covariant derivative}{\index{covariant!derivative}
        Let $(M,g)$ be a Riemannian manifold with associated Levi-Civita connection $\nabla$. The covariant derivative of a tensor distribution $T$ is defined using duality as follows (as in the case of Euclidean space this can be interpreted as an extension of the integration-by-parts formula):
        \begin{gather}
            \langle\nabla T,\sigma\rangle := -\langle T,g\cdot\nabla\sigma \rangle,
        \end{gather}
        where $g\cdot\nabla\sigma$ denotes the \textbf{internal contraction} (generalizing the divergence of a vector field) which, in local coordinates, is given by
        \begin{gather}
            (g\cdot\nabla\sigma)^{i_1\ldots i_p} = \nabla_j\sigma^{ji_1\ldots i_p}.
        \end{gather}
    }

    Definition \ref{distributions:wave_front_set} can easily be generalized to smooth manifolds:
    \newdef{Wave front set}{\index{wave!front}
        The wave front set of a distribution $\phi\in D'(M)$ is defined as follows:
        \begin{gather}
            \mathrm{WF}(\phi) := \{(x,v)\in T^*M_0\mid v\in\Sigma_x(\phi)\},
        \end{gather}
        where the singular fibre $\Sigma_x(\phi)$ is defined as in the Euclidean case (since by localization one can restrict to a chart containing $x$ and work in local coordinates).
    }

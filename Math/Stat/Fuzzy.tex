\chapter{Fuzzy Set Theory}

    The main reference for the basics on fuzzy sets is the original paper \cite{fuzzy}. For the basics of (ordered) sets, see Section \ref{section:ordered_sets} at the beginning of this compendium.

    This chapter begins with a small organizational remark. Although the content of the current chapter fits better in the parts on general set theory and logic, it does use more advanced concepts from for example topology and category theory. Furthermore, the main application here is the characterization of uncertainty in statistics and machine learning. For that reason it was added here.

\section{Fuzzy sets}

    \newdef{Fuzzy set}{\index{fuzzy!set}\index{empty}
        Consider a set $X$ (this set corresponds to the universe of discours in e.g. type theory or category theory). A fuzzy subset of $X$ is a function $A:X\rightarrow[0,1]$. One can interpret the value $A(x)$ at a point $x\in X$ as the grade of membership of $x$ in $A$. If the function $A$ only takes on values in $\{0,1\}$, the indicator function of an ordinary subset is obtained.

        A fuzzy set is said to be \textbf{empty} if its defining function is identically zero.

    \remark{One can generalize this definition by replacing $[0,1]$ by a more general poset (with the necessary properties).}

    \newdef{Pullback}{\index{pullback!of a fuzzy set}
        Consider two sets $X,Y$ and a fuzzy subset $A$ of $Y$. Given a function $f:X\rightarrow Y$ one can define the pullback $f^*A$ as usual:
        \begin{gather}
            f^*A(x) := A(f(x)).
        \end{gather}
    }

    The following definition is an immediate generalization of Definition \ref{set:relation}:
    \newdef{Fuzzy relation}{\index{fuzzy!relation}
        A fuzzy subset of the product set $X\times X$. This definition can be extended to $n$-ary relations by considering fuzzy subsets of the $n$-fold product $X\times\cdots\times X$.

        The composition in Definition \ref{set:relational_composition} can be extended through the following formula:
        \begin{gather}
            S\circ R(x,z) := \sup_{y\in X}\min\big(R(x,y),S(y,z)\big).
        \end{gather}
    }

    A more exotic construction for fuzzy sets is the following one (note that this only works if the codomain of fuzzy sets is $[0,1]$):
    \newdef{Convex combination}{\index{convex}
        Consider three fuzzy sets $A,B,\Lambda$. The convex combination $C\equiv(A,B;\Lambda)$ is defined as follows in analogy to Definition \ref{calculus:convex}:
        \begin{gather}
            C(x) := \Lambda(x)A(x) + (1-\Lambda(x))B(x).
        \end{gather}
    }

\chapter{Supersymmetry}

    The main reference for supersymmetric quantum mechanics is the seminal paper \textit{Witten} \cite{witten_morse}. For an introduction to algebraic superstructures, see Section \ref{section:graded_spaces}.

    This chapter is not meant to be an in-depth study of supersymmetry and its implications for (particle) physics. It will only introduce some concepts and constructions that are widely used in the study of supersymmetric theories. It also contains some sections on certain interesting mathematical properties that arise while studying supersymmetry.

\section{Quantum mechanics}

    In this section a general graded Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ will be considered. This space is equipped with an algebra of bounded operator $A\subset\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})$ together with a set of $N$ odd self-adjoint operators $\{D^i\}_{i\leq N}$. More precisely, a \textit{spectral triple} $(\mathcal{H},A,\{D^i\}_{i\leq N})$ is considered.

    This data defines an SQM system if the Hamiltonian $H$ satisfies the following condition:
    \begin{gather}
        \{D^i,D^j\}_+ = 2\delta^{ij}H.
    \end{gather}
    For $N=2$ the whole theory can be rephrased in terms of a nilpotent operator $d\sim D^1+iD^2$ and its adjoint:
    \begin{gather}
        \{d,d^\dagger\}_+\sim H.
    \end{gather}

    \begin{example}[Particle on a manifold]
        The archetypal example of such $N=2$ systems is the situation where $d$ is the exterior derivative on a smooth manifold $M$, $A$ is the algebra of smooth functions $C^\infty(M)$ and $\mathcal{H}$ is the Hilbert space of square-integrable forms with respect to the Hodge metric
        \begin{gather}
            \langle\alpha|\beta\rangle = \int_M\alpha\wedge\ast\beta.
        \end{gather}
    \end{example}

    The above superalgebra is that of a $D=1,N=2$ theory, i.e. there are two generators acting on a one-dimensional manifold. However, this system can be deformed to represent a $D=2,N=1$ theory. Let $e^{W(t)}$ be a one-parameter subgroup of invertible operators. The $W$-deformed operators are defined as follows:
    \begin{align}
        d^W &:= e^{-W(t)}\circ d\circ e^{W(t)}\\
        (d^W)^\dagger &:= e^{W(t)^\dagger}\circ d^\dagger\circ e^{-W(t)^\dagger}.
    \end{align}
    It is not hard to see that these deformed operators preserve the superalgebra. Although many authors assume $W$ to be a smooth function, this is not necessary. In fact many interesting examples involve more exotic choices. For example, \cite{phd_schreiber} considers a loop space $\Omega M$ (a theory of closed strings), where the the deformation operator at a point $\gamma\in\Omega M$ is given by
    \begin{gather}
        W(\gamma)\omega := \int_\gamma dt\ B_{\mu\nu}(\gamma(t))dx^\mu(t)\wedge dx^\nu(t)\wedge\omega(t),
    \end{gather}
    i.e. the operator takes the exterior product with a given two-form field (e.g. the \textit{Kalb-Ramond field}) and integrates over the loop $\gamma$ (after pairing with a set of vector fields). When restrictied to the class of skew-Hermitian operators, these deformations can be shown to be pure gauge.

\subsection{Loop space mechanics}

    An interesting setting for supersymmetric quantum mechanics is the situation mentioned at the end of the previous section, namely where the base manifold is a loop space $\Omega M$. In this case the tangent space $T_p\Omega M$ is the space of vector fields along the path $p$. As such they carry two indices, one with respect to a (local) frame field on $M$ and one coming from the $S^1$-parametrization of loops. A holonomic basis is given by functional derivatives:
    \begin{gather}
        \partial_{\mu,\sigma} := \frac{\delta}{\delta X^\mu(\sigma)},
    \end{gather}
    where $X^\mu(\sigma)$ is the $\mu^{th}$ coordinate of the loop at the parameter $\sigma\in[0,2\pi[\,$.

\section{Extensions of the Standard Model}

    \begin{theorem}[Coleman-Mandula]\index{Coleman-Mandula}
        Consider a quantum field theory satisfying the following conditions:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item There exists a mass gap.
            \item For every mass scale $M$ there exist only finitely many particle species with mass $m\leq M$.
            \item The two-point scattering amplitudes are nonvanishing for almost every energy.
            \item The (two-point) scattering amplitudes are analytic in the particle momenta.
        \end{enumerate}
        If the symmetry group of the $S$-matrix contains a subgroup isomorphic to the Poincar\'e group\footnote{Technically its universal cover should be considered.}, it can be written as the direct product of the Poincar\'e group and an internal gauge group.
    \end{theorem}
    \sremark{In other words, it is impossible to combine the Poincar\'e group in a nontrivial way with the internal symmetry group.}

    Now the question arises if one can do better, i.e. is there a nontrivial way to extend this total symmetry group? A first possibility was given by conformal field theories in Chapter \ref{chapter:cft}. CFTs do not admit an $S$-matrix and, hence, the above theorem is clearly not applicable. However, a second and more intricate possibility is given by supersymmetry. Here, one does not work with an ordinary symmetry Lie algebra\footnote{See the original paper \cite{coleman_mandula} for why exactly the algebra plays an essential role.} but with a Lie superalgebra \ref{hda:lie_superalgebra}. By allowing superspaces or, equivalently, by allowing fermionic symmetry generators, one can generalize the Coleman-Mandula theorem. The resulting generalization was proven by \textit{Sohnius, Lopusza\'nski} and \textit{Haag}.\index{Sohnius-Lopusza\'nski-Haag}

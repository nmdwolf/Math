\chapter{Astronomy \& Cosmology}

    The content of this chapter consists of two main (related) topics. The first one will be astronomy, which can mostly be treated by classical mechanics (and some general relativity). For some background, see \namecrefs{chapter:lagrange}~\ref{chapter:lagrange} and~\ref{chapter:GR}. The second part will consist of more quantum-mechanical systems such as black holes and inflation.

    \begin{property}[Stress-energy tensor]
        Let us consider a theory that is invariant under conformal transformations. The generator of general coordinate transformations is the stress-energy tensor $T$ (the associated current is $\mathcal{J}_\mu = T_{\mu\nu}\varepsilon^\nu$). Requiring conformal invariance then leads to the stress-energy tensor being traceless:
        \begin{gather}
            T^\mu_{\ \mu} = 0.
        \end{gather}
    \end{property}

\section{\texorpdfstring{In dimension $d=2$}{In dimension d=2}}

    In dimension 2 (in Euclidean signature) something special happens. By inserting $d=2$ in the conformal Killing equation we obtain the Cauchy-Riemann equations. The scale factor can thus be written as
    \begin{gather}
        \Omega(x) = \left|\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}\right|^2
    \end{gather}
    for some analytic function $f(z)$. Because of this\footnote{and because we in general look at conformal compactifications (see below)} we will from here one always work in complex coordinates. Switching to complex coordinates also has important consequences for the metric and stress-energy tensor:
    \begin{align}
        g_{zz} = g_{\zbar\zbar} = 0&\qquad g_{z\zbar} = \frac{1}{2}\\
        \partial_zT_{\zbar\zbar} = \partial_{\zbar} T_{zz} = 0&\qquad T_{z\zbar} = 0.
    \end{align}
    The stress-energy tensor thus contains a meromorphic\footnote{The literature often just calls this holomorphic.} component $T_{zz}\equiv T(z)$ and an anti-meromorphic component $T_{\zbar\zbar}\equiv\overline{T}(\zbar)$.

    \newdef{Witt algebra}{\index{Witt algebra}\label{cft:witt_algebra}
        Infinitesimally this gives us an infinite-dimensional algebra. As generators\footnote{These generate the transformation $z\mapsto z-z^{n+1}$ and $\zbar\mapsto\zbar-\zbar^{n+1}$ respectively.} we choose
        \begin{align}
            l_n(z) &:= -z^{n+1}\partial_z\\
            \overline{l}_n(\zbar)&:=-\zbar^{n+1}\partial_{\zbar}.
        \end{align}
        These differential oeprators generate isomorphic Lie algebras with the following commutation relation:
        \begin{gather}
            [l_m, l_n] = (m-n)l_{m+n}.
        \end{gather}
        This Lie algebra is called the \textbf{Witt algebra}.
    }

    \begin{remark}
        Often one finds in the literature that the conformal group of a 2D CFT is infinite-dimensional. However, this statement is not entirely true. It is true that the Witt algebra is infinite-dimensional, but one cannot globally exponentiate all generators $l_m$. First of all it should be remarked that the space of all holomorphic functions does not even have a group structure because the composition of holomorphic functions does not have to be holomorphic. The correct conformal group for 2D Euclidean CFT's is the M\"obius group $\text{PSL}(2, \mathbb{C})$. This group is obtained as the Lie group generated by $l_0$ and $l_{\pm1}$ (the only generators that can be exponentiated globally).

        What is true is that the conformal group of 2D Minkowski space is infinite-dimensional. It can be shown that $\text{Conf}(\mathbb{R}^{1, 1})$ is isomorphic to $\text{Diff}(S^1)_+\times\text{Diff}(S^1)_+$ where the (orientation-preserving) diffeomorphism group Diff$(S^1)_+$ is indeed an infinite-dimensional Lie group (see the intermezzo further below).

        At last we should comment that although the conformal group of $\mathbb{R}^{2, 0}$ is finite-dimensional, the infinite-dimensionality of the Witt algebra (and of its extensions) is sufficient for all physical purposes. The algebraic constraints turn this theory into an integrable theory and allow us to solve it exactly.
    \end{remark}

    \newdef{Primary field}{\index{primary!field}\index{conformal!weight}
        A quasi-primary field is defined as any field that transforms tensorially under global conformal transformations:
        \begin{gather}
            \phi'(z', \zbar') = \left(\pderiv{f}{z}\right)^h\left(\pderiv{f}{\zbar}\right)^{\overline{h}}\phi(f(z), \overline{f}(\zbar))..
        \end{gather}
        Fields that satisfy this relation for all conformal transformations are called primary fields. The tuple $(h, \overline{h})$ is called the \textbf{conformal weight} of the field.
    }

\subsection{\difficult{Intermezzo: Minkowski space}}

    As mentioned in the remark above, the conformal group of 2D Minkowski space is infinite-dimensional. The theory of infinite-dimensional manifolds is however a bit more intricate than the theory of finite-dimensional manifolds. A little introduction is therefore in order. ?? MOVE THIS TO CHAPTER ''INFINITE'' ??

    \newdef{Fr\'echet manifold}{
        A Fr\'echet manifold is a Hausdorff space $M$ together with an atlas of coordinate charts $(U, \varphi)$ such that $\varphi:U\rightarrow F_U$ are homeomorphisms onto a Fr\'echet space and such that the transition functions are smooth maps (of Fr\'echet spaces).
    }

    Using the above definitions we can start to analyze the group Diff$(S^1)_+$. First of all we look at the space of all smooth maps $S^1\rightarrow S^1$. This space has the structure of a Fr\'echet manifold modelled on the Fr\'echet space $\mathfrak{X}(S^1)$ of vector fields on the circle\footnote{By this definition we see that $\mathfrak{X}(S^1)$ is isomorphic (as a Lie algebra) to the mapping space $C^\infty(S^1, \mathbb{R})$. Henceforth we identify vector fields $v$ with their corresponding function $\xi$.}:
    \begin{gather}
        \mathfrak{X}(S^1) = \left\{\xi(\theta)\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}:\theta\in C^\infty(S^1)\right\}.
    \end{gather}
    Let $V_0$ be the set of vector fields which have norm $||v||\leq\pi$ and let $U_0$ be the set of smooth mappings $f\in C^\infty(S^1, S^1)$ such that $f(\theta)\neq-\theta$ for all $\theta\in S^1$. Then there exists a diffeomorphism $\psi:V_0\rightarrow U_0$ which assigns to any vector field $v$ the function $\psi_v:S^1\rightarrow S^1$ such that the arc between $\theta$ and $\psi_v(\theta)$ has length $||v(\theta)||$. If we choose an open subset $U\subset U_0$ of diffeomorphisms then we obtain a chart $(U, \psi^{-1})$ around the identity map. Charts around any diffeomorphism $f:S^1\rightarrow S^1$ are obtained by left multiplication of $U$.

    The Lie algebra of Diff$(S^1)_+$ is accordingly given by $\mathfrak{X}(S^1)$ but the induced Lie bracket is the commutator of vector fields with the opposite sign: \[[\cdot, \cdot]_{Lie} = -[\cdot, \cdot]_{\mathfrak{X}(S^1)}.\] Now it is interesting to note that the Witt algebra is actually a subalgebra of $\mathfrak{X}(S^1)$. Consider the maps $\xi_n(\theta):=-ie^{in\theta}$ (the minus sign is a convention). The associated vector fields then satisfy
    \begin{gather}
        \left[\xi_k(\theta)\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}, \xi_l(\theta)\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\right] = -i(l-k)\xi_{k+l}(\theta)\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}.
    \end{gather}
    These are exactly the relations for the Witt algebra.

\section{Quantization}

    \sremark{From here one we will always work in 2 dimensions.}

\subsection{Radial quantization}

    The charge of a conserved current $\mathcal{J}^\mu$ is generally given by the following formula\footnote{See Noether's theorem \ref{qft:noethers_theorem}.}:
    \begin{gather}
        Q = \int_\Sigma\mathcal{J}^0(x, t)
    \end{gather}
    where $\Sigma$ is a spacelike hypersurface. Often we will compactify the spatial dimension (this can be seen as some kind of regularization) and Wick rotate the time dimension. By a conformal transformation one can then go back to the plane (mapping one end of the cylinder to the origin and the other side to a circle at $+\infty$). After these transformations we obtain the following form for an operator on the plane:
    \begin{gather}
        Q_\varepsilon = \frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint dz\varepsilon(z)T(z) + \frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint d\zbar\varepsilon(\zbar)\overline{T}(\zbar).
    \end{gather}
    As usual we expect an infinitesimal transformation of a field $\phi$ to be given by the commutator $[Q_\varepsilon, \phi(w, \overline{w})]$ or in integral form by\footnote{We implicitly assumed a holomorphic split such that we can ignore (antiholomorphic) $\overline{T}(\zbar)$ contributions.} \[\frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint dz\varepsilon(z)[T(z)\phi(w, \overline{w}) - \phi(w, \overline{w})T(z)].\] However, because all the objects in this formula are operators we should take into account the operator ordering. On the plane this is given by the so-called \textbf{radial ordering}:\index{radial ordering}
    \begin{gather}
        \mathcal{R}(A(z, \zbar)B(w, \overline{w})) =
        \begin{cases}
            A(z, \zbar)B(w, \overline{w})&|z|>|w|\\
            B(w, \overline{w})A(z, \zbar)&|w|>|z|.
        \end{cases}
    \end{gather}
    After a deformation of the integration contour we obtain the following general formula:
    \begin{gather}
        [Q_\varepsilon, \phi(w, \overline{w})] = \frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint dz\varepsilon(z)\mathcal{R}(T(z)\phi(w, \overline{w}))
    \end{gather}
    where the contour is now a circle around the point $w$. For primary fields with conformal weight $h$ one can also write an infinitesimal transformation as \[\delta_\varepsilon\phi(z, \zbar) = h(\partial_z\varepsilon(z))\phi(z, \zbar) + \partial_z\phi(z, \zbar).\] Comparing these two expressions leads us to the following form of the operator product:
    \begin{gather}
        \mathcal{R}(T(z)\phi(w, \overline{w})) = \frac{h}{(z-w)^2}\phi(w, \overline{w}) + \frac{1}{z-w}\partial_w\phi(w, \overline{w}) + \text{higher order in } (z-w)
    \end{gather}
    An expression of this form is called an \textbf{operator product expansion} (OPE).\nomenclature[A_OPE]{OPE}{operator product expansion}

\subsection{Virasoro algebra}\index{Virasoro algebra}

    When going from classical systems to quantum systems we have to replace symmetry actions by (unitary) projective representations. As in the case of ordinary groups, the projective representations of Lie groups are related to central extensions. As an example of the Lie group-Lie algebra correspondence it can be shown that central extensions of Lie algebras (see section \ref{section:central_extension_algebra}) are in correspondence with central extensions of Lie groups.

    If we now want a quantum theory equipped with an action of the conformal group, then we need to construct a central extension of the Witt algebra. By applying the construction of section \ref{section:central_extension_algebra} we obtain the \textbf{Virasoro algebra} as a (universal) central extension of the Witt algebra by\footnote{The reason why we extend by $\mathbb{C}$ instead of $\mathbb{R}$ is that we are working with complexified Lie algebras.} $\mathbb{C}$ associated to the cocycle
    \begin{gather}
        \Theta:(L_m, L_n)\mapsto\frac{c}{12}m(m^2-1)\delta_{m+n, 0}.
    \end{gather}

    To obtain the Virasoro algebra from a more physical point of view we look at the stress-energy tensor. If we choose the current $\mathcal{J}^n(z) := z^{n+1}T(z)$, we expect to obtain the transformation $z\longrightarrow z-z^{n+1}$. In analogy with the generators of the Witt algebra (definition \ref{cft:witt_algebra}) we call this generator $L_n$:
    \begin{gather}
        L_n := \frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint dzz^{n+1}T(z).
    \end{gather}
    This relation can be inverted using the residue theorem to obtain the following expression for (the holomorphic component of) the stress-energy tensor:
    \begin{gather}
        T(z) = \sum_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}z^{-n-2}L_n.
    \end{gather}
    Using the above expression and the product operator expansion of $T(z)T(w)$ one obtains exactly the commutation relations of the Virasoro algebra:
    \begin{gather}
        [L_m, L_n] = (m-n)L_{m+n} + \frac{c}{12}m(m^2-1)\delta_{m+n, 0}.
    \end{gather}
    The occurrence of the central charge $c$ gives a conformal anomaly on quantization (see the definition of the vacuum further below). However, the central charge does not affect the $\mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb{C})$ subalgebra spanned by $L_{-1}, L_0$ and $L_1$. This implies that concepts such as the conformal weight are still useful.

\subsection{Representation theory}

    \newdef{Highest weight state}{
        A state with minimal eigenvalue for $L_0$. Equivalently, a state that is annihilated by all generators $L_n$ for $n\geq1$:
        \begin{gather}
            L_n|h\rangle = 0.
        \end{gather}
    }

    \newdef{Vacuum}{\index{vacuum}
        Consider the Virasoro generators $\{L_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}$. The vacuum $|0\rangle$ is defined as the maximally symmetric state. In terms of generators this means that \[L_n|0\rangle = 0\] for as many $n\in\mathbb{Z}$ as possible. However, due to the Virasoro commutation relations (and in particular the central charge) this is not possible for all $n\in\mathbb{Z}$. Instead one can only require that this expression vanishes for all $n\geq-1$.
    }

    \newdef{Descendants}{
        By acting with the generators $L_n$, where $n\leq-1$, on a highest weight state $|h\rangle$ one obtains a whole family of states. These are called the descendants of $|h\rangle$ and together they span the Verma module\footnote{See definition \ref{lie:verma_module}.} (associated to $|h\rangle$).

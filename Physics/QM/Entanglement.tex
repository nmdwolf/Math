\chapter{Entanglement in QFT}

    This chapter should be seen as a generalization of the content (in particular the characterization and computation of entanglement) in chapter \ref{chapter:quantum_computing} to the continuum setting. The main reference is \cite{entanglement_entropy, tuybens}.

\section{Lattice theories}

    In this section we remind the reader of the most important definitions and constructions in ordinary quantum information theory by applying it to a lattice theory. Taking the lattice spacing to zero will then let us extend the definitions to continuum field theories (up to some technicalities that we will explain when necessary). For simplicity we will assume that the local Hilbert space is finite-dimensional.

    Consider a bipartite subdivision $A\cup A^c$ of the lattice, given by a codimension-1 hypersurface $\partial A$ (called the \textbf{entangling surface}).\index{entangling surface} This induces a binary factorization of the total Hilbert space (we assume that all degrees of freedom are confined to individual vertices) and hence we can compute the reduced density matrix for either ($A$ or its complement $A^c$). The eigenvalues (which solely depend on the entangling surface $\partial A$) allow us to calculate the von Neumann entropy:\footnote{Certain assumption ought to be made as to keep the entropy finite whenever the state-space is infinite-dimensional since it can be shown that the set of states with infinite von Neumann entropy is trace norm-dense (see \cite{Eisert_entropy}).}
    \begin{gather}
        S(\rho_A) := -\text{tr}(\rho_A\ln\rho_A) = -\sum_i\rho_i\ln\rho_i.
    \end{gather}
    In the same way we can also introduce the R\'enyi $q$-entropy:\index{entropy!R\'enyi}
    \begin{gather}
        S_q(\rho_A) := \frac{1}{1-q}\ln\left(\sum_i\rho_i^q\right).
    \end{gather}
    \begin{property}[Limiting case]
     First of all one can analytically continue the definition of the $q$-entropy to arbitrary positive real numbers. The limit $q\rightarrow1$ coincides with the von Neumann entropy.
    \end{property}

\section{Postulates}

    \begin{axiom}[State spaces]
        The states of a (closed) system are represented by vectors in a (complex) Hilbert space. In the infinite-dimensional setting one often further restricts to separable spaces, i.e. the spaces are required to admit a countable Hilbert basis.
    \end{axiom}

    \begin{axiom}[Observables]\index{observable}
        A self-adjoint operator. In the finite-dimensional case this is equivalent to an operator that admits a complete set of eigenfunctions.
    \end{axiom}

    \begin{axiom}[Rays]
        The dynamics of the system do not depend on the global phase or normalization, states are represented by rays in a projective Hilbert space.
    \end{axiom}

\subsection{Observables}

    \begin{formula}\index{eigenfunction!expansion}
        Let $|\Psi\rangle$ be a state vector representing a given system and let $\{|\psi_i\rangle\}_{i\in I}$ be a complete set of eigenvectors of some observable of the system. The state vector $|\Psi\rangle$ can be expressed as a linear combination of the eigenfunctions:
        \begin{gather}
            \label{qm_formalism:eigenfunction_expansion}
            |\Psi\rangle = \sum_ic_i|\psi_i\rangle + \int c_a|\psi_a\rangle da,
        \end{gather}
        where the summation ranges over the discrete spectrum and the integral over the continuous spectrum (see Section \ref{section:spectrum}).
    \end{formula}

    \begin{formula}[Closure relation]\index{closure!relation}\index{resolution!of the identity}
        For a complete set of discrete eigenvectors the closure relation (also called the \textbf{resolution of the identity}) is given by
        \begin{gather}
            \label{qm_formalism:closure}
            \sum_n|\psi_n\rangle\langle\psi_n| = \mathbbm{1}.
        \end{gather}
        For a complete set of continuous eigenvectors the following counterpart holds:
        \begin{gather}
            \label{qm_formalism:closure_continuouos}
            \int|x\rangle\langle x|dx = \mathbbm{1}.
        \end{gather}
        For a mixed set of eigenvectors a similar relation is obtained by summing over the discrete part and integrating over the continuous part. For simplicity the notation of equation \eqref{qm_formalism:closure} will also be used for the continuous part.
    \end{formula}

    \newdef{Canonical commutation relations}{\index{CCR}\index{Weyl!relations}\label{qm_formalism:CCR}
        \nomenclature[A_CCR]{CCR}{canonical commutation relation}
        Two observables $A,B$ are said to obey a canonical commutation relation (CCR) if they satisfy (up to a constant factor $\hbar$)
        \begin{gather}
            [A,B] = i.
        \end{gather}
        The prime examples are the position and momentum operators $\hat{x}, \hat{p}$. Through functional calculus one can also define the exponential operators $e^{isA}$ and $e^{itB}$. The above relation then induces the so-called \textbf{Weyl form} of the CCR:
        \begin{gather}
            e^{isA}e^{itB} = e^{ist}e^{itB}e^{isA}.
        \end{gather}
    }
    \begin{theorem}[Stone-von Neumann]\index{Stone-von Neumann}\label{qm_formalism:stone_von_neumann}
        All pairs of irreducible, unitary, one-parameter subgroups satisfying the Weyl form of the CCRs are unitarily equivalent.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{result}
        The Schr\"odinger and Heisenberg pictures are unitarily equivalent.
    \end{result}

\section{Symmetries}
\subsection{Quantum symmetries}

    \newdef{State space}{
        By the postulates of quantum mechanics, the states in a quantum theory are represented by rays in the projective Hilbert space $\mathbb{P}\mathcal{H}$. Probabilities are defined through the \textit{Fubini-Study metric} on $\mathbb{P}\mathcal{H}$ as follows:
        \begin{gather}
            \mathcal{P}(\psi,\phi) := \cos^2\big[d_\mathrm{FS}(\psi,\phi)\big] = \frac{|\langle\psi|\phi\rangle|^2}{\langle\psi|\psi\rangle\langle\phi|\phi\rangle},
        \end{gather}
        where $|\psi\rangle,|\phi\rangle$ are representatives of the states $\psi,\phi$ in $\mathbb{P}\mathcal{H}$.
    }

    \newdef{Symmetry}{\index{symmetry}\index{automorphism!quantum}
        A quantum symmetry (or \textbf{quantum automorphism}) is an isometric automorphism of $P\mathcal{H}$. The group of these symmetries is denoted by $\Aut_\mathrm{QM}(\mathbb{P}\mathcal{H})$.
    }

    The following theorem due to \textit{Wigner} gives a (linear) characterization of quantum symmetries:\footnote{It is a particular case of a more general theorem in projective geometry.}
    \begin{theorem}[Wigner]\index{Wigner}
        Every quantum automorphism of $\mathbb{P}\mathcal{H}$ is induced by a unitary or anti-unitary operator on $\mathcal{H}$.
    \end{theorem}
    This is equivalent to saying that the group morphism \[\pi:\Aut(\mathcal{H},\mathcal{P}):=\mathrm{U}(\mathcal{H})\times\mathrm{AU}(\mathcal{H})\rightarrow\Aut_\mathrm{QM}(\mathbb{P}\mathcal{H})\] is surjective. Together with the kernel $\mathrm{U}(1)$, given by phase shifts, this forms a short exact sequence:
    \begin{gather}
        1\longrightarrow\mathrm{U}(1)\longrightarrow\Aut(\mathcal{H},\mathcal{P})\longrightarrow\Aut_\mathrm{QM}(\mathbb{P}\mathcal{H})\longrightarrow1.
    \end{gather}
    In the case of symmetry breaking (e.g. lattice systems), the full symmetry group is reduced to a subgroup $G\subset\Aut_\mathrm{QM}(\mathbb{P}\mathcal{H})$. The group of operators acting on $\mathcal{H}$ is then given by the pullback $\widetilde{G}$ of the diagram \[\Aut(\mathcal{H}, \mathcal{P})\longrightarrow\Aut_\mathrm{QM}(\mathbb{P}\mathcal{H})\longleftarrow G.\] It should also be noted that the kernel of the homomorphism $\widetilde{G}\rightarrow G$ is again $\mathrm{U}(1)$. This leads to the property that $\widetilde{G}$ is a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-twisted (hence noncentral) $\mathrm{U}(1)$-extension of $G$ (where the twist is induced by the homomorphism $\phi:\Aut(\mathcal{H},\mathcal{P})\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}_2$ that says whether an operator is unitary or anti-unitary).

\subsection{Symmetric states}

    \begin{axiom}[Symmetrization postulate]\index{symmetrization postulate}
        Let $\mathcal{H}$ be the single-particle Hilbert space. A system of $n$ identical particles is described by a state $|\Psi\rangle$ belonging to either $S^n\mathcal{H}$ or $\Lambda^n\mathcal{H}$, i.e. \textbf{bosonic} and \textbf{fermionic} states are of the form
        \begin{gather}
            |\Psi_B\rangle = \sum_{\sigma\in S_n}|\psi_{\sigma(1)}\rangle\cdots|\psi_{\sigma(n)}\rangle
        \end{gather}
        and
        \begin{gather}
            |\Psi_F\rangle = \sum_{\sigma\in S_n}\sgn(\sigma)|\psi_{\sigma(1)}\rangle\cdots|\psi_{\sigma(n)}\rangle,
        \end{gather}
        respectively, where the $|\psi_i\rangle$ are single-particle states and $S_n$ is the permutation group on $n$ elements.
    \end{axiom}
    \begin{remark}
        In ordinary quantum mechanics this is a postulate, but in quantum field theory this is a consequence of the \textit{spin-statistics theorem}.
    \end{remark}

    \newdef{Slater determinant}{\index{Slater!determinant}\index{spin!orbitals}\index{permanent}
        Let $\{\phi_i(\vector{q})\}_{i\leq n}$ be a set of wave functions, called \textbf{spin orbitals}, describing a system of $n$ identical fermions. The totally antisymmetric wave function of the system is given by
        \begin{gather}
            \label{qm_formalism:slater_determinant}
            \psi(\vector{q}_1,\ldots,\vector{q}_n) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n!}}\det
            \begin{pmatrix}
                \phi_1(\vector{q}_1)&\cdots&\phi_n(\vector{q}_1)\\
                \vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\
                \phi_1(\vector{q}_n)&\cdots&\phi_n(\vector{q}_n)
            \end{pmatrix}
         \end{gather}
         A similar function can be defined for bosonic systems using the concept of \textit{permanents}.
    }

\section{Interaction picture}\index{interaction!picture}\label{section:interaction_picture}

    Let $\hat{H}(t)=\hat{H}_0+\hat{V}(t)$ be the total Hamiltonian of a system, where $\hat{V}(t)$ denotes the interaction potential. Let $|\psi(t)\rangle$ and $\hat{O}$ denote a state and operator in the Schr\"odinger picture.
    \begin{definition}[Interaction representation]
        In the interaction picture the state vector is defined as follows:
        \begin{gather}
            |\psi(t)\rangle_I := e^{\frac{i}{\hbar}\hat{H}_0t}|\psi(t)\rangle.
        \end{gather}
        From this it follows that the operators in the interaction picture are given by
        \begin{gather}
            \hat{O}_I(t) = e^{\frac{i}{\hbar}\hat{H}_0t}\,\hat{O}\,e^{-\frac{i}{\hbar}\hat{H}_0t}.
        \end{gather}
    \end{definition}
    \newformula{Schr\"odinger equation}{
        Using the previous formulas, the Schr\"odinger equation can be rewritten as follows:
        \begin{gather}
            i\hbar\deriv{}{t}|\psi(t)\rangle_I = \hat{V}_I(t)|\psi(t)\rangle_I.
        \end{gather}
        The time-evolution of operators in the interaction picture is given by
        \begin{gather}
            \deriv{}{t}\hat{O}_I(t) = \frac{i}{\hbar}\left[\hat{H}_0, \hat{O}_I(t)\right].
        \end{gather}
        States evolve solely based on the interaction terms and operators evolve according to the free (time-independent) Hamiltonian.
    }

    \begin{theorem}[Adiabatic theorem]\index{adiabatic!theorem}
        If a perturbation is acting slowly enough on a system such that the system can adapt its configuration at every single moment, the system will remain in the same eigenstate.
    \end{theorem}
    \sremark{The original formulation by \textit{Born} and \textit{Fock} also required the system to be \textit{gapped}. However, later this was shown to be inessential.}

\section{\difficult{Curved backgrounds}}

    Using the tools of distribution theory and differential geometry (Chapters \ref{chapter:distributions}, \ref{chapter:bundles} and onwards), one can introduce quantum mechanics on curved backgrounds (in the sense of ``space'', not ``spacetime'').

    \begin{remark}[Rigged Hilbert spaces]\index{Hilbert!rigged Hilbert space}
        A first important remark to be made is that the classical definition of the wave function as an element of $L^2(\mathbb{R}^d,\mathbb{C})$ is not sufficient, even in flat Cartesian space. A complete description requires the introduction of so-called \textit{Gelfand triples} or \textit{rigged Hilbert spaces}, where the space of square-integrable functions is replaced by the Schwartz space \ref{distribution:schwartz_space} of rapidly decreasing functions. The linear functionals on this space are then given by the tempered distributions.
    \end{remark}

    When working on curved spaces or even in non-Cartesian coordinates on flat space, one can encounter problems with the definition of the self-adjoint operators $\hat{q}^i$ and $\hat{p}_i$. The naive definition $\hat{q}^i = q^i,\hat{p}_i = -i\partial_i$ gives rise to extra terms that break the canonical commutation relations and the self-adjointness of the operators (e.g. the angular position operator $\hat{\varphi}$ on the circle together with its conjugate $\hat{L}$) when calculating inner products.

    An elegant solution to this problem is obtained by giving up the definition of the wave function as a well-defined function $\psi:\mathbb{R}^d\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$:
    \begin{quote}
        Assume that the physical space has the structure of a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ and that the ``naive'' wave functions take values in a vector space $V$. Then, construct a vector bundle $E$ with typical fibre $V$ over $M$. By Property \ref{bundle:section_bijection} an invariant description of the ``true'' wave function is a map $\Psi:F(E)\rightarrow V$ or, locally, the pullback $\psi:=\varphi^*\Psi$ for some local section $\varphi:U\subseteq M\rightarrow F(E)$. The Levi-Civita connection on $M$ also induces a covariant derivative $\nabla$ on $E$ that can be used to define differential operators.

        Now, a general inner product can be introduced:
        \begin{gather}
            \langle\psi,\phi\rangle := \int d^dx\sqrt{\det(g)}\overline{\psi}(x)\phi(x).
        \end{gather}
        Because the factor $\sqrt{\det(g)}$ transforms in the inverse manner of the measure $d^dx$, the integrand is invariant under coordinate transforms (something that is generally required of physical laws). Using this new inner product one can for example check the self-adjointness of the momentum operator $\hat{P}_i := -i\nabla_i$:
        \begin{align*}
            \langle\psi,\hat{P}_i\phi\rangle = &\int d^dx\sqrt{\det(g)}\,\overline{\psi}(x)(-i\nabla_i)\phi(x)\\
            \overset{\eqref{bundle:local_covariant_derivative}}{=} &\int d^dx\sqrt{\det(g)}\,\overline{\psi}(x)(-i\partial_i - i\omega_i)\phi(x)\\
            = &i\int d^dx\left(\partial_i\sqrt{\det(g)}\right)\overline{\psi}(x)\phi(x) + \int d^dx\sqrt{\det(g)}\,\overline{(-i\partial_i\psi)}(x)\phi(x)\\
                &\hspace{2cm} -i\int d^dx\sqrt{\det(g)}\,\overline{\psi}(x)\omega_i\phi(x)\\
            = &\langle\hat{P}_i\psi,\phi\rangle -i\int d^dx\sqrt{\det(g)}\,\overline{\psi}(x)\overline{\omega_i}\phi(x)\\
                &\hspace{2cm} + i\int d^dx\left(\partial_i\sqrt{\det(g)}\right)\overline{\psi}(x)\phi(x)\\
                &\hspace{2cm} -i\int d^dx\sqrt{\det(g)}\,\overline{\psi}(x)\omega_i\phi(x).
        \end{align*}
        Self-adjointness then requires that
        \begin{gather}
            \sqrt{\det(g)}(\omega_i + \overline{\omega_i}) = \partial_i\sqrt{\det(g)}
        \end{gather}
        or
        \begin{gather}
            2\mathrm{Re}(\omega_i) = \partial_i\ln\left(\sqrt{\det(g)}\right).
        \end{gather}

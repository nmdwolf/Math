\section{Lippman-Schwinger equations}

	In this section we consider Hamiltonians of the following form: $\hat{H} = \hat{H}_0 + \hat{V}$ where $\hat{H}_0$ is the free Hamiltonian and $\hat{V}$ the scattering potential. We will also assume that both the total Hamiltonian and the free Hamiltonian have the same eigenvalues.

	\newformula{Lippman-Schwinger equation}{\index{Schwinger!Lippman-Schwinger equation}
    	\begin{equation}
    		|\psi^{(\pm)}\rangle = |\varphi\rangle + \stylefrac{1}{E - \hat{H}_0 \pm i\varepsilon}\hat{V}|\psi^{(\pm)}\rangle
    	\end{equation}
        where $|\varphi\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the free Hamiltonian with the same energy as $|\psi\rangle$.
    }
    \remark{The term $\pm i\varepsilon$ is added to the denominator as otherwise it would be singular. It has no real physical meaning.}
    
    \newformula{Born series}{\index{Born!series}
    	If we rewrite the Lippman-Schwinger equation as$|\psi\rangle = |\varphi\rangle + \hat{G}_0\hat{V}|\psi\rangle$, were $\hat{G}_0$ is the Green's operator, then we can derive the following series expansion by iterating the equation:
        \begin{equation}
        	\label{QM:cattering:born_series}
            |\psi\rangle = |\varphi\rangle + \hat{G}_0\hat{V}|\varphi\rangle + \left(\hat{G}_0\hat{V}\right)^2|\varphi\rangle + ...
        \end{equation}
    }
    \newformula{Born approximation}{\index{Born!approximation}
    	If we cut off the Born series at the first order term in $\hat{V}$ then we obtain the Born approximation:
        \begin{equation}
        	\label{QM:scattering:born_approximation}
            |\psi\rangle = |\varphi\rangle + \hat{G}_0\hat{V}|\varphi\rangle
        \end{equation}

	\newdef{Transcendental element}{\index{transcendental}\index{algebraic}
		Consider a base field $k$ and a field extension $L/k$. An element $x\in L$ for which there exists no non-trivial polynomial $p$ over $k$ such that $p(x) = 0$ is said to be transcendental. Otherwise it is said to be \textbf{algebraic}.

	\newdef{Algebraic independence}{
		Consider a base field $k$ and a field extension $L/k$. A subset $S\subseteq L$ is said to be algebraically independent over $k$ if the elements of $S$ do not satisfy any non-trivial polynomial over $k$.

\subsection{Spectrum of a ring}

	\newdef{Spectrum}{\index{spectrum}\index{Zariski topology}
		\nomenclature[S_Spec]{Spec$(R)$}{Spectrum of a commutative ring $R$.}
		Let $R$ be a commutative ring. The spectrum Spec$(R)$ is defined as the set of prime ideals of $R$. This set can be turned into a topological space by equipping it with the \textbf{Zariski topology}: Let $V_I$ be the set of prime ideals containing the ideal $I$. The collection of closed sets, inducing the Zariski topology, is given by $\{V_I\}_{I\text{ ideal of }R}$.
	}
	\remark{A basis for the above topology is given by the sets $D_f = \{I_p\not\ni f:f\in R, I_p \text{ is a prime ideal}\}$.}
	
	\begin{property}
		Spec$(R)$ is a compact $T_0$ space.
	\end{property}
	
	\newdef{Structure sheaf}{\index{structure!sheaf}
		Given a spectrum $X=$ Spec$(R)$, equipped with its Zariski topology, we can define a sheaf\footnotemark\ $\mathcal{O}_X$ by setting $\forall f\in R: \Gamma(D_f, \mathcal{O}_X) = R_f^*$, where $R_f^*$ is the localization of $R$ with respect to the monoid of powers of $f$. When 
		\footnotetext{In fact this is merely a \textit{B-sheaf} as it is only defined on the basis of the topology. However, every B-sheaf can be extended to a sheaf by taking the appropriate limits.}
	}
	
	\begin{property}
		The spectrum Spec$(R)$ together with its structure sheaf forms a ringed space.
	\end{property}

\subsection{Affine schemes}

	\newdef{Affine scheme}{\index{scheme}
		A ringed space, isomorphic to the spectrum Spec$(R)$ for some commutative ring $R$, is called an affine scheme.

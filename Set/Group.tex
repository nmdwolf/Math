        	\footnotetext{Also called an Abelian group.}
        	Let $(G, \star)$ be a group. If $\star$ is commutative, then $G$ is called a commutative group.
        }

\subsection{Cosets}

        \newdef{Coset}{\index{coset}\index{normal!group}\label{group:coset}
        	Let $G$ be a group and $H$ a subgroup of $G$. The left coset of $H$ with respect to $g\in G$ is defined as the set
            \begin{equation}
            	gH = \{gh: h\in H\}
            \end{equation}
            The right coset is analogously defined as $Hg$. If for all $g\in G$ the left and right cosets coincide then the subgroup $H$ is said to be a \textbf{normal subgroup}. The sets of left and right cosets are denoted by $G/H$ and $H\backslash G$ respectively.
        }
        
        \newdef{Quotient group}{\index{quotient!group}\label{group:quotient_group}
        	Let $G$ be a group and $N$ a normal subgroup. The quotient group $G/N$ is defined as the set of cosets of $N$ in $G$. This set can be turned into a group itself by equipping it with a product such that the product of $aN$ and $bN$ is $(aN)(bN)$. The fact that $N$ is a normal subgroup can be used to rewrite this as $(aN)(bN) = (ab)N$.
        }
        
        \newdef{Center}{\index{center}
        	The center of a group is defined as follows:
            \begin{equation}
            	\label{group:center}
                Z(G) = \{z\in G: \forall g\in G , zg = gz\}
            \end{equation}
            This set is a normal subgroup of $G$.

\subsection{Order}
        
        \newdef{Order of a group}{\index{order}
        	The number of elements in the group. It is denoted by $|G|$ or $\text{ord}(G)$.
        }
        \newdef{Order of an element}{
        	The order of an element $a\in G$ is the smallest integer $n$ such that
        	\begin{equation}
        		a^n = e
        	\end{equation}
        	where $e$ is the identity element of $G$.
        }
        
        \newdef{Torsion group}{\index{torsion}\label{group:torsion_group}
        	A torsion group is a group for which all element have finite order. The torsion set $\text{Tor}(G)$ of a group $G$ is the set of all elements $a\in G$ that have finite order. For Abelian groups, $\text{Tor}(G)$ is a subgroup.
        }


\subsection{Symmetric and alternating groups}

	\newdef{Symmetric group}{
        	The symmetric group $S_n$ or $\text{Sym}_n$ of the set $V = \{1, 2, ..., n\}$ is defined as the set of all permutations of $V$. The number $n$ is called the \textbf{degree} of the symmetric group. The symmetric group $\text{Sym}(X)$ of a finite set $X$ is analogously defined.
        }
        \newdef{Alternating group}{
        	The alternating group $A_n$ is the subgroup of $S_n$ containing all even permutations.
        }
        
        \newdef{Cycle}{\index{cycle}
        	A $k$-cycle is a permutation of the form $(a_1\ a_2\ ...\ a_k)$ sending $a_i$ to $a_{i+1}$ (and $a_k$ to $a_1$). A \textbf{cycle decomposition} of an arbitrary permutation is the decomposition into a product of disjoint cycles.
        }
        \begin{formula}
        	Let $\tau$ be a $k$-cycle. Then $\tau$ is $k$-cyclic (hence the name \textit{cycle}):
            	\begin{equation}
            		\tau^k = \mathbbm{1}_G
	        \end{equation}
        \end{formula}
        \begin{example}
        	Consider the set $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$. The permutation $\sigma:x\mapsto x+2\ (\text{mod } 6)$ can be written using the cycle decomposition $\sigma = (1\ 3\ 5)(2\ 4\ 6)$.
        \end{example}
        
        \newdef{Transposition}{\index{transposition}
        	A permutation which exchanges two elements but lets the other ones unchanged.
        }

\subsection{Direct product}

	\newdef{Direct product}{\index{direct product! of groups}\label{group:direct_product}
		Let $G, H$ be two groups. The direct product $G\otimes H$ is defined as the set-theoretic Cartesian product $G\times H$ equipped with a binary operation $\cdot$ such that:
		\begin{equation}
			(g_1, h_1)\cdot(g_2, h_2) = (g_1g_2, h_1h_2)
		\end{equation}
		where the operations on the right hand side are the group operations in $G$ and $H$. The structure $G\otimes H = (G\times H, \cdot)$ forms a group.
	}
	\begin{notation}
		When the groups are Abelian, the direct product is sometimes called the \textbf{direct sum} and is denoted by $\oplus$.
	\end{notation}
	
	\newdef{Inner semidirect product}{\index{split}
		Let $G$ be a group, $H$ a subgroup of $G$ and $N$ a normal subgroup of $G$. $G$ is said to be the inner semidirect product of $H$ and $N$, denoted by $N\rtimes H$, if it satifies the following equivalent statements:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item $G = NH$ where $N\cap H = \{\mathbbm{1}\}$.
			\item For every $g\in G$ there exist unique $n\in N, h\in H$ such that $g=nh$.
			\item For every $g\in G$ there exist unique $h\in H, n\in N$ such that $g=hn$.
			\item There exists a group homomorphism $\rho:G\rightarrow H$ which satisfies $\rho|_H = \mathbbm{1}$ and $\ker(\rho)=N$.
			\item The composition of the natural embedding $i:H\rightarrow G$ and the projection $\pi:G\rightarrow G/N$ is an isomorphism between $H$ and $G/N$.
		\end{itemize}
		$G$ is also said to \textbf{split} over $N$.
	}
	\newdef{Outer semidirect product}{
		Let $G, H$ be two groups and let $\varphi:H\rightarrow\text{Aut}(G)$ be a group homomorphism. The outer semidirect product $G\rtimes_\varphi H$ is defined as the set-theoretic Cartesian product $G\times H$ equipped with a binary relation $\cdot$ such that:
		\begin{equation}
			(g_1, h_1)\cdot(g_2, h_2) = (g_1\varphi(h_1)(g_1), h_1h_2)
		\end{equation}
		The structure $(G\rtimes_\varphi H, \cdot)$ forms a group.
		
		By noting that the set $N = \{(g, \mathbbm{1}_H)|g\in G\}$ is a normal subgroup isomorphic to $G$ and that the set $B = \{(\mathbbm{1}_G, h)|h\in H\}$ is a subgroup isomorphic to $H$ we can also construct the outer semidirect product $G\rtimes_\varphi H$ as the inner semidirect product $N\rtimes H$.
	}
	
	\begin{remark}
		The direct product of groups is a special case of the outer semidirect product where the group homomorphism is given by the trivial map $\varphi:h\mapsto \mathbbm{1}_G$.
	\end{remark}


\subsection{Free groups}

	\newdef{Free Abelian group}{\index{free!group}\index{basis}\index{rank}
		An abelian group $G$ with generators $\{g_i\}_{i\in I}$ is said to be freely generated if every element $g\in G$ can be uniquely written as a formal linear combination of the generators:
		\begin{equation}
			G = \left\{\left.\sum_ia_ig_i\right|a_i\in\mathbb{Z}\right\}
		\end{equation}
		The set of generators $\{g_i\}_{i\in I}$ is then called a \textbf{basis}\footnote{In analogy with the basis of a vector space.}\ of $G$. The number of elements in the basis is called the \textbf{rank} of $G$.
	}
	\begin{property}
		Consider a free group $G$. Let $H\subset G$ be a subgroup. Then $H$ is also free.
	\end{property}
	
	\begin{theorem}\label{group:theorem:free_group}
		Let $G$ be a finitely generated Abelian group of rank $n$, i.e. its basis has $n$ elements. This group can be constructed in two different ways:
		\begin{equation}
			G = F/H
		\end{equation}
		where both $F, H$ are freely and finitely generated Abelian groups. The second decomposition is:
		\begin{equation}
			G = A\oplus T\qquad\text{where}\qquad T = Z_{h_1}\oplus\cdots\oplus Z_{h_m}
		\end{equation}
		where $A$ is a freely and finitely generated group of rank $n-m$ and all $Z_{h_i}$ are cyclic groups of order $h_i$. The group $T$ is called the torsion subgroup\footnote{See also definition \ref{group:torsion_group}.}. The rank $n-m$ and the numbers $h_i$ are unique.
	\end{theorem}

\subsection{Group presentations}

	\newdef{Relations}{\index{relation}
		Let $G$ be a group. If the product of a number of elements $g\in G$ is equal to the identity $e$ then this product is called a relation on $G$.
	}
	\newdef{Complete set of relations}{
		Let $H$ be a group generated by a subgroup $G$. Let $R$ be a set of relations on $G$. If $H$ is uniquely (up to an isomorphism) determined by $G$ and $R$ then the set of relations is said to be complete.
	}

	\newdef{Presentation}{\index{presentation}
		Let $H$ be a group generated by a subgroup $G$ and a complete set of relations $R$ on $G$. The pair $(G, R)$ is called a presentation of $H$.
		
		It is clear that every group can have many different presentations and that it is (very) difficult to tell if two groups are isomorphic by just looking at their presentations.
	}

\subsection{Group actions}

        \newdef{Group homomorphism}{\index{homomorphism!of groups}
        	A group homomorphism $\Phi:G\rightarrow H$ is a map satisfying $\forall g, h \in G$

	        \end{equation}
        }
        
        \begin{theorem}[First isomorphism theorem]\index{isomorphism!theorem}\label{group:theorem:first_isomorphism_theorem}
        	Let $G, H$ be a groups and let $\varphi:G\rightarrow H$ be a group homomorphism. If $\varphi$ is surjective than $G/\ker\varphi\cong H$.
        \end{theorem}
        
        \newdef{Group action}{\index{group!action}\label{group:group_action}
        	Let $G$ be a group. Let $V$ be a set. A map $\rho: G\times V \rightarrow V$ is called an action of $G$ on $V$ if it satisfies the following conditions:
        	\begin{itemize}
                	\item Identity: $\rho(\mathbbm{1}_G, v) = v$
                	\item Compatibility: $\rho(gh, v) = \rho(g, \rho(h, v))$
		\end{itemize}
		For all $g, h \in G$ and $v\in V$. The set V is called a (left) \textbf{G-space}.
        }
        \begin{remark}\label{group:permutation_remark}
        	A group action can alternatively be defined as a group homomorphism from $G$ to $\text{Sym}(V)$. It assigns a permutation of $V$ to every element $g\in G$.
	\end{remark}
        
        \begin{notation}
        	The action $\rho(g, v)$ is often denoted by $g\cdot v$ or even $gv$.

		The orbit of an element $x\in X$ with respect to a group $G$ is defined as the set:
		\begin{equation}
			\label{group:orbit}
			G\cdot x = \{g\cdot x|g\in G\}
		\end{equation}
		The relation $p\sim q \iff \exists g\in G: p = g\cdot q$ induces an equivalence relation for which the equivalence classes coincide with the orbits of $G$. The set of equivalence classes $X/\sim$ (sometimes denoted by $X/G$) is called the \textbf{orbit space}.

		\end{equation}
		This is a subgroup of $G$.
	}
	
	\newdef{Free action}{\index{free}\label{group:free_action}
		A group action is free if $g\cdot x = x$ implies $g = e$ for every $x\in X$. Equivalently, a group action is free if the stabilizer group of all elements is trivial.
	}
	\newdef{Faithful action\footnotemark}{\index{faithful!action}\label{group:faithful_action}
		\footnotetext{A faithful action is also called an \textbf{effective} action.}
		A group action is faithful if the homomorphism $G\rightarrow\text{Sym}(X)$ is injective. Alternatively, a group action is faithful if for every two group elements $g, h\in G$ there exists an element $x\in X$ such that $g\cdot x\neq h\cdot x$.
	}
	
	\newdef{Transitive action}{\index{transitive!action}\label{group:transitive}
		A group action is transitive if for every two elements $x, y\in X$ there exists a group element $g\in G$ such that $g\cdot x = y$. Equivalently we can say that there is only one orbit.
	}
	\newdef{Homogeneous space}{\index{homogeneous!space}
		If the group action of a group $G$ on a $G$-space $X$ is transitive, then $X$ is said to be a homogeneous space.
	}
	\begin{property}[$\dag$]\label{group:transitive_action_property}
		Let $X$ be a set and let $G$ be a group such that the action of $G$ on $X$ is transitive. Then their exists a bijection $X\cong G/G_x$ where $G_x$ is the stabilizer of any element $x\in X$.
	\end{property}
        
        \newdef{G-module}{\index{module}
        	Let $G$ be a group. Let $M$ be a commutative group. $M$ equipped with a left group action $\varphi:G\times M\rightarrow M$ is a (left) G-module if $\varphi$ satisfies the following equation (distributivity):
		\begin{equation}
            		\label{group:g_module}
                	g\cdot(a+b) = g\cdot a + g\cdot b

	        \begin{equation}
        	    	g\cdot f(v) = f(g\cdot v)
        	\end{equation}
        	where the $\cdot$ symbol represents the group action in $W$ and $V$ respectively. It is sometimes called a \textbf{G-map}, a \textbf{G-equivariant map} or an \textbf{intertwining map}.

\subsection{Modules}
	
	\newdef{$R$-Module}{\index{module}
		Let $(R, +, \cdot)$ be a ring. A set $X$ is an $R$-module if it satisfies the same axioms as those of a vector space \ref{linalgebra:vector_space} but where the scalars are only elements of a ring instead of a field.
	}
	
	\begin{property}\label{algebra:module_basis}
		For a general $R$-module the existence of a basis is not guaranteed unless $R$ is a division ring. See construction \ref{linalgebra:hamel_basis} to see how this basis can be constructed.

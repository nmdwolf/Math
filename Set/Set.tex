	}
    
\section{Axiomatization}
\subsection{ZFC}

	The following set of axioms and axiom schemes gives a basis for axiomatic set theory whih fixes a number of issues in naieve set theory where one takes the notion of set for granted. This theory is called \textbf{Zermelo-Frenkel} set theory (ZF). When extended with the axiom of choice (see further) it is called ZFC, where the C stand for "choice".
	
	\begin{axiom}[Extensionality]\index{extensionality}
		\begin{equation}
			\forall x, y:\forall z\big[z\in x \iff z\in y\big]\implies x=y
		\end{equation}
	\end{axiom}
	
	\begin{axiom}[Regularity]\index{regularity}
		\begin{equation}
			\forall x:\exists z\big[z\in x\big]\implies \exists a\big[a\in x \land \neg\exists b(b\in a \land b\in x)\big]
		\end{equation}
		This axiom says that for every non-empty set $x$ one can find an element $a\in x$ such that $x$ and $a$ are disjoint. Among other things this axiom implies that no set can contain itself.
	\end{axiom}
	
	The following axiom is technically not an axiom but an axiom schema.
	\begin{axiom}[Specification]\index{specification}
		For every predicate $\varphi$ one obtains an axiom:
		\begin{equation}
			\forall w_1, ..., w_n, A:\exists B:\forall x\big[x\in B\iff(x\in A\land \varphi(x, w_1, ..., w_n, A)\big]
		\end{equation}
		This axiom (schema) says that for every set $x$ one can build another set of elements in $x$ which satisfy a given predicate. By the axiom of extensionality this subset $B\subseteq A$ is unique.
	\end{axiom}

\subsection{Material set theory}

	ZF(C) is an instance of material set theory. Every element of a set is a set itself and hence has internal structure.

	\newdef{Pure set}{\index{pure!set}
		A set $U$ is pure if for every sequence $x_n\in x_{n-1} \in\cdots\in x_1\in U$ all the elements $x_i$ are also sets.
	}
	\newdef{Urelement\footnotemark}{\index{urelement}\index{atom}
		\footnotetext{Sometimes called an \textbf{atom}.}
		An object which is not a set.
	}

\subsection{Von Neumann-Bernays-G\"odel}

\subsection{Universes}

	\newdef{Grothendieck universe}{\index{Grothendieck!universe}
		A Grothendieck universe $U$ is a set satisfying following axioms:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Transitivity: If $x\in U$ and $y\in x$ then $y\in U$
			\item Power set: If $x\in U$ then $P(x)\in U$
			\item If $x, y\in U$ then $\{x, y\}\in U$
			\item Unions: If $I\in U$ and $\{x_i\}_{i\in I} \subset U$ then $\bigcup_{i\in I}x_i\in U$
		\end{enumerate}
	}

\subsection{Structural set theory}

	In contrast to material set theory the fundamental notions are sets and relations between them. An element of a set does not have any internal structure and so only becomes relevant if one specifies axtra structure (or relations) on the sets. This impies that elements of sets are not sets themselves as this is a meaningless statement since by default they lack internal structure. Even stronger, it is meaningless to compare two elements if one does not provide relations or extra structure on the sets.

		\begin{itemize}
			\item For every $i\in I$: $f_{ii} = e_i$, where $e_i$ is the identity in $A_i$.
			\item For every $i\leq j\leq k\in I$: $f_{ik} = f_{jk}\circ f_{ij}$.

		\footnotetext{Also called a \textbf{inductive limit}.}
		Consider a direct system $(A_i, f_{ij})$ over a (directed) set $I$. The direct limit $A$ of this direct system is defined as follows:
		\begin{equation}
			\label{direct_limit}
			\varinjlim A_i = \left.\bigsqcup_{i\in I}A_i\right/\sim
		\end{equation}
		where the equivalence relation is given by $x\in A_i\sim y\in A_j\iff\exists k\in I: f_{ik}(x) = f_{jk}(y)$. Informally put: two elements are equivalent if they eventually become the same.
		
		The algebraic operations on $A$ are defined such that the inclusion maps $\phi_i:A_i\rightarrow A$ are morphisms.
	}
	
\subsection{Inverse systems}

	\newdef{Inverse system}{\index{inverse!system}

		\begin{itemize}
			\item For every $i\in I$: $f_{ii} = e_i$, where $e_i$ is the identity in $A_i$.
			\item For every $i\leq j\leq k\in I$: $f_{ik} = f_{ij}\circ f_{jk}$.

		The pair $(A_i, f_{ij})$ is called an inverse system over I.
	}
	
	\newdef{Inverse limit\footnotemark}{\index{inverse!limit}\index{projective!limit}
		\footnotetext{Also called a \textbf{projective limit}.}
		Consider an inverse system $(A_i, f_{ij})$ over a (directed) set $I$. The inverse limit $A$ of this inverse system is defined as follows:
		\begin{equation}
			\label{inverse_limit}
			\varprojlim A_k = \left.\left\{\vec{a}\in\prod_{i\in I}A_i\right\vert a_i=f_{ij}(a_j), \forall i\leq j\in I\right\}
		\end{equation}
		For all $i\in I$ there exists a \textbf{natural projection} $\pi_i:\varprojlim A_k\rightarrow A_i$.
	}
	
	\begin{uproperty}
		Let $A$ be the inverse limit of a given inverse system. For any other inverse limit $A'$ over the same inverse system, there exists a unique isomorphism $\phi:A\rightarrow A'$.
	\end{uproperty}
	
	\begin{remark}
		The direct and inverse limit are each other's (categorical) dual. The former is a colimit while the latter is a limit in category theory.
	\end{remark}

\subsection{Exact sequences}

	\newdef{Exact sequence}{\index{exact!sequence}
		Consider a sequence (finite or infinite) of algebraic structures and their corresponding homomorphisms:

		\end{equation}
		The sequence is exact if for every $k\in\mathbb{N}: \text{im}(\Phi_k) = \text{ker}(\Phi_{k+1})$. This implies that $\Phi_{k+1}\circ\Phi_k = 0$ for all $h\in\mathbb{N}$. It follows that exact sequences are a special type of chain complex as defined in definition \ref{group:chain_complex}.

	\newdef{Short exact sequence}{
		A short exact sequence is an exact sequence of the form:
		\begin{equation}
			\label{short_exact_sequence}
			0\rightarrow A_0\xrightarrow{\Phi_1}A_1\xrightarrow{\Phi_2} A_3\rightarrow0
		\end{equation}
		A long exact sequence is an infinite exact sequence.

		\index{epimorphism}\index{monomorphism}\index{bimorphism}
		Looking at some small examples we can derive some important constraints for certain exact sequences and especially for short exact sequences. Consider the sequence
		\[
			0\rightarrow A\xrightarrow{\Phi} B
		\]
		This sequence can only be exact if $\Phi$ is an injective homomorphism (\textbf{monomorphism}). This follows from the fact that the only element in the image of the map $0\rightarrow A$ is 0 because the map is a homomorphism. The kernel of $\Phi$ is thus trivial which implies that $\Phi$ is injective.
		
		Analogously, the sequence
		\[
			A\xrightarrow{\Psi}B\rightarrow0
		\]
		is exact if $\Psi$ is a surjective homomorphism (\textbf{epimorphism}). This follows from the fact that the kernel of the map $B\rightarrow0$ and thus the image of $\Psi$ is all of $B$ which implies that $\Psi$ is surjective.
		
		It follows that the sequence
		\[
			0\rightarrow A\xrightarrow{\Sigma}B\rightarrow0
		\]
		is exact if $\Sigma$ is a \textbf{bimorphism} (which is often an isomorphism).

	\newdef{Composition}{\index{composition}
		Let $n\in\mathbb{N}$. A $k$-composition of $n$ is a $k$-tuple $(t_1, ..., t_k)$ such that $\sum_{i=1}^kt_k = n$.
	}
	\newdef{Partition}{\index{partition}
		Let $n\in\mathbb{N}$. A partition of $n$ is an ordered composition of $n$.

	\newdef{Young diagram\footnotemark}{\index{Young!diagram}\index{Ferrers diagram}
		\footnotetext{Sometimes called a \textbf{Ferrers diagram}.}
		A Young diagram is a visual representation of the partition of an integer $n$. It is a left justified system of boxes, where every row corresponds to a part of the partition.

	\newdef{Conjugate partition}{
		Let $\lambda$ be a partition of $n$ with Young diagram $\mathcal{D}$. The conjugate partition $\lambda'$ is obtained by reflecting $\mathcal{D}$ across its main diagonal.
	}
	\begin{example}
		Conjugating diagram \ref{fig:young_diagram} gives us the partition $(4, 3, 3, 3, 1)$ which is represented by:

\subsection{Superpartition}

	\newdef{Superpartition}{
		Let $n\in\mathbb{N}$. A superpartition in the $m$-fermion sector is a sequence of integers of the following form:
		\begin{equation}
			\Lambda = (\Lambda_1, ..., \Lambda_m;\Lambda_{m+1}, ..., \Lambda_N)
		\end{equation}
		where the first $m$ numbers are strictly ordered, i.e. $\Lambda_i>\Lambda_{i+1}$ for all $i< m$, and the last $N-m$ numbers form a normal partition.
		
		Both sequences, separated by a semicolon, form in fact distinct partitions themself. The first one represents the antisymmetric fermionic sector (this explains the strict order) and the second one represents the symmetric bosonic sector. This amounts to the following notation:\[\Lambda = (\lambda^a;\lambda^s)\]
		The degree of the superpartition is given by $n\equiv|\Lambda|=\sum_{i=1}^N$.
	}
	\begin{notation}
		A superpartition of degree $n$ in the $m$-fermion sector is said to be a superpartition of $(n|m)$. To every superpartition $\Lambda$ we can also associate a unique partition $\Lambda^*$ by removing the semicolon and reordering the numbers such that they form a partition of $n$. The superpartition $\Lambda$ can then be represented by the Young diagram belonging to $\Lambda^*$ where the rows belonging to the fermionic sector are ended by a circle.
	\end{notation}

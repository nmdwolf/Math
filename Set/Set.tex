		\nomenclature[S_P]{$P(S), 2^S$}{Power set of $S$.}
	    	Let $S$ be a set. The power set is defined as the set of all subsets of $S$ and is (often) denoted by $P(S)$ or $2^S$. The existence of this set is enforced by the \textit{axiom of power set}.

	\newdef{Family}{\index{family}
		Let $A$ be a set and let $I$ be another set, called the \textbf{index set}. A family of elements of $A$ is a map $f:I\rightarrow A$. A family with index set $I$ is often denoted by $(x_i)_{i\in I}$. In contrast to collections a family can 'contain' multiple copies of a single element.

\section{Ordered sets}
\subsection{Posets}
	
	\newdef{Preordered set}{\index{preorder}

	}
	\newdef{Partially ordered set}{\index{poset}\label{set:poset}
		A set $P$ equipped with a binary relation $\leq$ is called a partially ordered set (\textbf{poset}) if the following 3 axioms are fulfilled for all elements $a,b,c\in P$:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Reflexivity: $a\leq a$
			\item Antisymmetry: $a\leq b \land b\leq a\implies a = b$
			\item Transitivity: $a\leq b\land b\leq c\implies a\leq c$
		\end{enumerate}
		It is a preordered set for which the binary relation is also anti-symmetric.

		A non-strict order $\leq$ has an associated strict order $<$ that satisfies $a<b \iff a\leq b\land a\neq b$.
	}
	
	\newdef{Maximal element}{
		An element $m$ of a poset $P$ is maximal if for every $p\in P$, $m\leq p$ implies that $m=p$.

		A totally ordered subset of a poset is called a chain.
	}
	\begin{theorem}[Zorn's lemma\footnotemark]\index{Zorn's lemma}\label{set:zorns_lemma}
		\footnotetext{This theorem is equivalent to the \textit{axiom of choice}.}
		Let $(P, \leq)$ be a poset. If every chain in $P$ has an upper bound in $P$, then $P$ has a maximal element.
	\end{theorem}

	\newdef{Directed\footnotemark\ set}{\index{directed set}\index{filtered set|see{directed set}}
		\label{set:directed_set}
		\footnotetext{Sometimes called an \textit{upward} directed set. Downward directed sets are analogously defined with a lower bound for every two elements. Directed sets are also sometimes called \textbf{filtered sets}.}
		A directed set is a set $X$ equipped with a preorder $\leq$ and with the additional property that every 2-element subset has an upper bound, i.e. for every two elements $a, b\in X$ there exists an element $c\in X$ such that $a\leq c\land b\leq c$.
	}
	\newdef{Net}{\index{net}\label{set:net}
		A net on a set $X$ is a subset of $X$ indexed by a directed set $I$.

\subsection{Lattices}

	\newdef{Semilattice}{\index{join}\index{meet}
		A poset $(P, \leq)$ for which every 2-element subset has a supremum (also called a \textbf{join}) in $P$ is called a join-semillatice. Similarly, a poset $(P, \leq)$ for which every 2-element subset has an infimum (also called a \textbf{meet}) in $P$ is called a meet-semilattice.
	}
	\begin{notation}
		The join of $\{a, b\}$ is denoted by $a\land b$. The meet of $\{a, b\}$ is denoted by $a\lor b$.
	\end{notation}
	\newdef{Lattice}{\index{lattice!set theory}
		A poset $(P, \leq)$ is called a lattice if it is both a join- and a meet-semilattice.
	}
	The above definition also allows for a purely algebraic formulation:
	\newadef{Lattice}{
		A lattice is an algebraic structure that contains the operations $\land, \lor$ and the constants $\top, \bot$ which satisfy the following axioms:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Both $\land$ and $\lor$ are idempotent, commutative and associative.
			\item They satisfy the \textbf{absorption laws}:
			\begin{gather}
				a\lor (a\land b) = a\qquad\qquad a\land (a\lor b) = a
			\end{gather}
			\item $\top$ and $\bot$ are the respective identities of $\land$ and $\lor$
		\end{enumerate}
		To go from this definition to the order-theoretic one we set $a\leq b \iff a\land b=a$ (there exists an equivalent relation for the join).
	}
	
	\newdef{Bounded lattice}{
		A lattice $(P, \leq)$ is called bounded if it contains a greatest element (denoted by $\top$ or 1) and a smallest element (denoted by $\bot$ or 0) such that:
		\begin{gather}
			\bot\leq x\leq\top
		\end{gather}
		for all $x\in P$. These elements are the identities for the join and meet operations:
		\begin{gather}
			x\land\top=x\qquad\qquad x\lor\bot=x
		\end{gather}
	}
	
	\newdef{Frame}{\index{frame!set theory}\label{set:frame}
		A poset $(P, \leq)$ which admits all joins\footnote{When working with categories this has to be restricted to "all small joins", or equivalently, the index category should be a set.} and all finite limits and for which the \textbf{infinite distributivity law} is satisfied:
		\begin{gather}
			y\wedge\left(\bigvee_{i\in I}x_i\right) = \bigvee_{i\in I}\left(y\wedge x_i\right)
		\end{gather}
	}
	
	\newdef{Heyting algebra}{\index{Heyting!algebra}\index{complement}\label{set:heyting}
		A bounded lattice $H$ such that for every two elements $a, b\in H$ there exists a greatest element $x\in H$ for which
		\begin{gather}
			a\wedge x\leq b
		\end{gather}
		This element is denoted by $a\rightarrow b$. The \textbf{pseudo-complement} $\neg a$ of an element $a\in H$ is then defined as $a\rightarrow\bot$.
	}
	\newdef{Boolean algebra}{\index{law of excluded middle}\index{Boolean!algebra}
		A Boolean algebra is a Heyting algebra in which the \textit{law of excluded middle} holds:
		\begin{gather}
			\forall x: \neg\neg x=x
		\end{gather}
		or equivalently:
		\begin{gather}
			\forall x: x\lor\neg x=\top

	\end{axiom}
        \sremark{There is only one way to extend the field of rational numbers to the field of reals such that it satisfies the two previous axioms. This means that for every possible construction, their exists a bijection between the two.}

		        \item Closed under countable unions: $\forall\{E_i\}_{i=1}^n\subset\Sigma:\bigcup_{i=1}^nE_i\in\Sigma$
		\end{enumerate}
	}
	\begin{remark}
    		Axioms $(2)$ and $(3)$ together with de Morgan's laws\footnotemark\ imply that a $\sigma$-algebra is also closed under countable intersections.

	\newdef{Product $\sigma$-algebra}{\label{set:product_of_sigma_algebras}
		The smallest $\sigma$-algebra containing the products $A_1\times A_2$ for all $A_1\in\mathcal{F}_1, A_2\in\mathcal{F}_2$ is called the product $\sigma$-algebra of $\mathcal{F}_1$ and $\mathcal{F}_2$.

	\end{notation}
    
	\begin{adefinition}
		The product $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{F}$ can also be equivalently defined in the following two ways:
        	\begin{itemize}

			L_c(f) = \{x\in X:f(x) = c\}

\section{Axiomatization}
\subsection{ZFC}

	The following set of axioms and axiom schemes gives a basis for axiomatic set theory whih fixes a number of issues in naieve set theory where one takes the notion of set for granted. This theory is called \textbf{Zermelo-Frenkel} set theory (ZF). When extended with the axiom of choice (see further) it is called ZFC, where the C stand for "choice".
	
	\begin{axiom}[Extensionality]\index{extensionality}
		\begin{gather}
			\forall x, y:\forall z\big[z\in x \iff z\in y\big]\implies x=y
		\end{gather}
	\end{axiom}
	
	\begin{axiom}[Regularity]\index{regularity}
		\begin{gather}
			\forall x:\exists z\big[z\in x\big]\implies \exists a\big[a\in x \land \neg\exists b(b\in a \land b\in x)\big]
		\end{gather}
		This axiom says that for every non-empty set $x$ one can find an element $a\in x$ such that $x$ and $a$ are disjoint. Among other things this axiom implies that no set can contain itself.
	\end{axiom}
	
	The following axiom is technically not an axiom but an axiom schema.
	\begin{axiom}[Specification]\index{specification}
		For every predicate $\varphi$ one obtains an axiom:
		\begin{gather}
			\forall w_1, ..., w_n, A:\exists B:\forall x\big[x\in B\iff(x\in A\land \varphi(x, w_1, ..., w_n, A)\big]
		\end{gather}
		This axiom (schema) says that for every set $x$ one can build another set of elements in $x$ which satisfy a given predicate. By the axiom of extensionality this subset $B\subseteq A$ is unique.
	\end{axiom}

\subsection{Material set theory}

	ZF(C) is an instance of material set theory. Every element of a set is a set itself and hence has internal structure.

	\newdef{Pure set}{\index{pure!set}
		A set $U$ is pure if for every sequence $x_n\in x_{n-1} \in\cdots\in x_1\in U$ all the elements $x_i$ are also sets.
	}
	\newdef{Urelement\footnotemark}{\index{urelement}\index{atom}
		\footnotetext{Sometimes called an \textbf{atom}.}
		An object which is not a set.
	}

\subsection{Universes}

	\newdef{Grothendieck universe}{\index{Grothendieck!universe}
		A Grothendieck universe $U$ is a set satisfying following axioms:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Transitivity: If $x\in U$ and $y\in x$ then $y\in U$
			\item Power set: If $x\in U$ then $P(x)\in U$
			\item If $x, y\in U$ then $\{x, y\}\in U$
			\item Unions: If $I\in U$ and $\{x_i\}_{i\in I} \subset U$ then $\bigcup_{i\in I}x_i\in U$
		\end{enumerate}
	}

\subsection{Structural set theory}

	In contrast to material set theory the fundamental notions are sets and relations between them. An element of a set does not have any internal structure and so only becomes relevant if one specifies axtra structure (or relations) on the sets. This impies that elements of sets are not sets themselves as this is a meaningless statement since by default they lack internal structure. Even stronger, it is meaningless to compare two elements if one does not provide relations or extra structure on the sets.

\subsection{ETCS}

	As this axiomatization 

	\sremark{ETCS is the abbreviation of `'Elementary Theory of the Category of Sets''.}

	\begin{axiom}
		The category of sets is a well-pointed (elementary) topos

		\begin{itemize}
			\item For every $i\in I$: $f_{ii} = e_i$, where $e_i$ is the identity in $A_i$.
			\item For every $i\leq j\leq k\in I$: $f_{ik} = f_{jk}\circ f_{ij}$.
		\end{itemize}
		The pair $(A_i, f_{ij})$ is called a direct system over I.

	\newdef{Direct limit\footnotemark}{\index{direct!limit}\index{inductive limit}
		\footnotetext{Also called a \textbf{inductive limit}.}
		Consider a direct system $(A_i, f_{ij})$ over a (directed) set $I$. The direct limit $A$ of this direct system is defined as follows:
		\begin{gather}
			\label{direct_limit}
			\varinjlim A_i = \left.\bigsqcup_{i\in I}A_i\right/\sim
		\end{gather}
		where the equivalence relation is given by $x\in A_i\sim y\in A_j\iff\exists k\in I: f_{ik}(x) = f_{jk}(y)$. Informally put: two elements are equivalent if they eventually become the same.
		
		The algebraic operations on $A$ are defined such that the inclusion maps $\phi_i:A_i\rightarrow A$ are morphisms.
	}
	
\subsection{Inverse systems}

	\newdef{Inverse system}{\index{inverse!system}
		Let $(I, \leq)$ be a directed set\footnote{See definition \ref{set:directed_set}.}. Let $\{A_i\}_{i\in I}$ be a family of algebraic objects (groups, rings, ...) and let $\{f_{ij}:A_j\rightarrow A_i\}_{i,j\in I}$ be a set of morphisms with the following properties:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item For every $i\in I$: $f_{ii} = e_i$, where $e_i$ is the identity in $A_i$.
			\item For every $i\leq j\leq k\in I$: $f_{ik} = f_{ij}\circ f_{jk}$.
		\end{itemize}
		The pair $(A_i, f_{ij})$ is called an inverse system over I.
	}
	
	\newdef{Inverse limit\footnotemark}{\index{inverse!limit}\index{projective!limit}
		\footnotetext{Also called a \textbf{projective limit}.}
		Consider an inverse system $(A_i, f_{ij})$ over a (directed) set $I$. The inverse limit $A$ of this inverse system is defined as follows:
		\begin{gather}
			\label{inverse_limit}
			\varprojlim A_k = \left.\left\{\vec{a}\in\prod_{i\in I}A_i\right\vert a_i=f_{ij}(a_j), \forall i\leq j\in I\right\}
		\end{gather}
		For all $i\in I$ there exists a \textbf{natural projection} $\pi_i:\varprojlim A_k\rightarrow A_i$.
	}
	
	\begin{uproperty}
		Let $A$ be the inverse limit of a given inverse system. For any other inverse limit $A'$ over the same inverse system, there exists a unique isomorphism $\phi:A\rightarrow A'$.
	\end{uproperty}
	
	\begin{remark}
		The direct and inverse limit are each other's (categorical) dual. The former is a colimit while the latter is a limit in category theory.
	\end{remark}

\subsection{Exact sequences}

	\newdef{Exact sequence}{\index{exact!sequence}
		Consider a sequence (finite or infinite) of algebraic structures and their corresponding homomorphisms:
		\begin{gather}
			A_0\xrightarrow{\Phi_1}A_1\xrightarrow{\Phi_2}\cdots\xrightarrow{\Phi_n}A_n
		\end{gather}
		The sequence is exact if for every $k\in\mathbb{N}: \text{im}(\Phi_k) = \text{ker}(\Phi_{k+1})$. This implies that $\Phi_{k+1}\circ\Phi_k = 0$ for all $h\in\mathbb{N}$. It follows that exact sequences are a special type of chain complex as defined in definition \ref{group:chain_complex}.
	}
	
	\newdef{Short exact sequence}{
		A short exact sequence is an exact sequence of the form:
		\begin{gather}
			\label{short_exact_sequence}
			0\rightarrow A_0\xrightarrow{\Phi_1}A_1\xrightarrow{\Phi_2} A_3\rightarrow0
		\end{gather}
		A long exact sequence is an infinite exact sequence.
	}
	
	\begin{property}
		\index{epimorphism}\index{monomorphism}\index{bimorphism}
		Looking at some small examples we can derive some important constraints for certain exact sequences and especially for short exact sequences. Consider the sequence
		\[
			0\rightarrow A\xrightarrow{\Phi} B
		\]
		This sequence can only be exact if $\Phi$ is an injective homomorphism (\textbf{monomorphism}). This follows from the fact that the only element in the image of the map $0\rightarrow A$ is 0 because the map is a homomorphism. The kernel of $\Phi$ is thus trivial which implies that $\Phi$ is injective.
		
		Analogously, the sequence
		\[
			A\xrightarrow{\Psi}B\rightarrow0
		\]
		is exact if $\Psi$ is a surjective homomorphism (\textbf{epimorphism}). This follows from the fact that the kernel of the map $B\rightarrow0$ and thus the image of $\Psi$ is all of $B$ which implies that $\Psi$ is surjective.
		
		It follows that the sequence
		\[
			0\rightarrow A\xrightarrow{\Sigma}B\rightarrow0
		\]
		is exact if $\Sigma$ is a \textbf{bimorphism} (which is often an isomorphism).

\subsection{Partition}
	\newdef{Composition}{\index{composition}
		Let $n\in\mathbb{N}$. A $k$-composition of $n$ is a $k$-tuple $(t_1, ..., t_k)$ such that $\sum_{i=1}^kt_k = n$.
	}
	\newdef{Partition}{\index{partition}
		Let $n\in\mathbb{N}$. A partition of $n$ is an ordered composition of $n$.
	}
	
	\newdef{Young diagram\footnotemark}{\index{Young!diagram}\index{Ferrers diagram}
		\footnotetext{Sometimes called a \textbf{Ferrers diagram}.}
		A Young diagram is a visual representation of the partition of an integer $n$. It is a left justified system of boxes, where every row corresponds to a part of the partition.
		\begin{figure}[!ht]
			\centering
			\ydiagram{5, 4, 4, 1}
			\caption{A Young diagram representing the partition $(5, 4, 4, 1)$ of 14.}
			\label{fig:young_diagram}
		\end{figure}
	}
	\newdef{Conjugate partition}{
		Let $\lambda$ be a partition of $n$ with Young diagram $\mathcal{D}$. The conjugate partition $\lambda'$ is obtained by reflecting $\mathcal{D}$ across its main diagonal.
	}
	\begin{example}
		Conjugating diagram \ref{fig:young_diagram} gives us the partition $(4, 3, 3, 3, 1)$ which is represented by:
		\begin{figure}[!ht]

			\caption{A Young diagram representing the partition $(4, 3, 3, 3, 1)$ of 14.}
			\label{fig:young_diagram_conj}
		\end{figure}
	\end{example}
	
	\newdef{Young tableau}{\index{Young!tableaux}
		Consider a Young diagram of shape $\lambda$. A standard young tableau of shape $\lambda$ is a filling of the corresponding Young diagram such that every column and row is non-increasing.
	}
	
	\begin{formula}[Hook length formula]\index{hook length}
		The \textbf{hook} $H_{i,j}$ is defined as the part of a Young diagram given by the cell $(i,j)$ together with all cells below and to the right of $(i,j)$. Given a hook $H_{i,j}$ we define the hook length $h_{i,j}$ as the sum of all elements in $H_{i,j}$.
		
		The number of all possible standard Young tableaux of shape $\lambda$ (where $\lambda$ defines a partition of $n$) is given by the following formula:
		\begin{gather}
			f^\lambda = \frac{n!}{\prod_{(i,j)\in\lambda}h_{i,j}}
		\end{gather}
	\end{formula}
	
	\newdef{Young tabloid}{
		A Young tabloid of shape $\lambda$ is defined as the equivalence class of Young tableaux which are connected by permuting the elements within a row. These are often drawn in the following way:
		\begin{figure}[!ht]
			\centering
			\ytableausetup{boxsize=normal,tabloids}\begin{ytableau}1&2&3&5&8\\ 4&6&9&10\\ 7&11&12&14\\ 15\end{ytableau}

\subsection{Superpartition}

	\newdef{Superpartition}{
		Let $n\in\mathbb{N}$. A superpartition in the $m$-fermion sector is a sequence of integers of the following form:
		\begin{gather}
			\Lambda = (\Lambda_1, ..., \Lambda_m;\Lambda_{m+1}, ..., \Lambda_N)
		\end{gather}
		where the first $m$ numbers are strictly ordered, i.e. $\Lambda_i>\Lambda_{i+1}$ for all $i< m$, and the last $N-m$ numbers form a normal partition.
		
		Both sequences, separated by a semicolon, form in fact distinct partitions themself. The first one represents the antisymmetric fermionic sector (this explains the strict order) and the second one represents the symmetric bosonic sector. This amounts to the following notation:\[\Lambda = (\lambda^a;\lambda^s)\]
		The degree of the superpartition is given by $n\equiv|\Lambda|=\sum_{i=1}^N$.
	}
	\begin{notation}
		A superpartition of degree $n$ in the $m$-fermion sector is said to be a superpartition of $(n|m)$. To every superpartition $\Lambda$ we can also associate a unique partition $\Lambda^*$ by removing the semicolon and reordering the numbers such that they form a partition of $n$. The superpartition $\Lambda$ can then be represented by the Young diagram belonging to $\Lambda^*$ where the rows belonging to the fermionic sector are ended by a circle.
	\end{notation}

	\newdef{Field extension}{\index{field!extension}
		Let $k$ be a field. A field extension of $k$ is a field $K$ such that $k\subset K$ and such that the operations of $k$ coincide with the ones of $K$ restricted to $k$.
	}
	\begin{notation}
		A field extension $K$ of $k$ is often denoted by $K/k$.

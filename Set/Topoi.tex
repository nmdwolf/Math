\section{Elementary topoi}

	\newdef{Elementary topos}{\index{topos!elementary}
		An elementary topos is a category in which all power objects and all finite limits exist. Equivalently one can define an elementary topos as a cartesian closed category which has a subobject classifier and in which all finite limits exist.
	}
	
\section{Internal logic}\label{cat:internal_logic}

	In this subsection we consider categories with all finite limits and a subobject classifier (so they don't have to be a topos).
	
	\newdef{Truth value}{\index{truth value}
		A global element of the subobject classifier, i.e. a morphism $\mathbf{1}\rightarrow\Omega$. The subobject classifier $\Omega$ is hence also sometimes called the \textbf{object of truth values}.
	}
	
	\begin{property}
		The subobject classifier is an internal poset.
	\end{property}

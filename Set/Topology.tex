	\newdef{Topology}{\index{topology}
		\nomenclature[S_Top]{$\text{Top}$}{Category of topological spaces.}
    		Let $\Omega$ be a set. Let $\tau\subseteq 2^\Omega$. The set $\tau$ is a topology on $\Omega$ if it satisfies following axioms:
	        \begin{enumerate}
        		\item $\emptyset\in\tau$ and $\Omega\in\tau$
        		\item $\forall\ \mathcal{F}\subseteq\tau: \bigcup_{V\in\mathcal{F}}V \in \tau$
		        \item $\forall\ U, V\in\tau: U\cap V\in\tau$
	        \end{enumerate}
        	Furthermore we call the elements of $\tau$ open sets and the couple $(\Omega, \tau)$ a topological space.
	}
	\sremark{On topological spaces the open sets are thus defined by axioms.}
	
	\begin{property}
		\nomenclature[S_Open]{$\text{Open}(X)$}{Category of open subsets of a topological space $X$.}
		Consider a topological space $(X, \tau)$. Let $U\subseteq V\in\tau$. The inclusion maps $U\hookrightarrow V$ are morphisms. The set of these morphisms together with the topology $\tau$ form a (small) category $\text{Open}(X)$.
	\end{property}

	\newdef{Relative topology\footnotemark}{
		\footnotetext{Sometimes called the \textbf{subspace topology}.}
		Let $(X, \tau_X)$ be a topological space and $Y$ a subset of $X$. We can turn $Y$ into a topological space by equipping it with the following topology:
		\begin{equation}
			\label{topology:relative_topology}
			\tau_\text{rel} = \{U_i\cap Y:U_i\in \tau_X\}
		\end{equation}
	}
	
	\newdef{Disjoint union}{\index{disjoint union}\label{topology:disjoint_union}
		Let $\{X_i\}_{i\in I}$ be a family of topological spaces. Now consider the disjoint union
		\begin{equation}
			X = \bigsqcup_{i\in I} X_i
		\end{equation}
		together with the canonical inclusion maps $\phi_i:X_i\rightarrow X:x_i\mapsto(x_i, i)$. We can turn $X$ into a topological space by equipping it with the following topology:
		\begin{equation}
			\tau_X = \{U\subseteq X| \forall i\in I:\phi_i^{-1}(U)\text{ is open in }X_i\}
		\end{equation}
	}

	\newdef{Quotient space}{\index{quotient!space}
		Let $X$ be a topological space and let $\sim$ be an equivalence relation defined on $X$. The set $X/_\sim$ can be turned into a topological space by equipping it with the following topology:
		\begin{equation}
			\label{topology:quotient_space}
			\tau_\sim = \{U\subseteq X/_\sim|\pi^{-1}(U)\text{ is open in }X\}
		\end{equation}
		where $\pi$ is the canonical surjective map from $X$ to $X/_\sim$.
	}

	\begin{example}[Discrete topology]\index{discrete!topology}
		The discrete topology is the topology such that every subset is open (and thus also closed).
	\end{example}
	
	\begin{example}[Product topology]\index{product!topology}\index{Tychonoff!topology}\label{topology:tychonoff_topology}
		First consider the case where the index set $I$ is finite. The product space $X = \prod_{i\in I}X_i$ can be turned into a topological space by equipping it with the topology generated by the following basis:
		\begin{equation}
			\mathcal{B} = \left\{\left.\prod_{i\in I}U_i\ \right|U_i\in\tau_i\right\}
		\end{equation}
		For general cases (countably infinite and uncountable index sets) the topology can be defined using the canonical projections $\pi_i:X\rightarrow X_i$. The general product topology (\textbf{Tychonoff topology}) is the coarsest (finest) topology such that all projections $\pi_i$ are continuous.
	\end{example}
	
	\newdef{Topological group}{\index{group!topological}
		A topological group is a group $G$ equipped with a topology such that both the multiplication and inversion map are continuous.
	}
	
	
	\newdef{Pointed topological space}{\label{topology:pointed_space}
		Let $x_0\in X$. The triple $(X, \tau, x_0)$ is called a pointed topological space with base point $x_0$.
	}
	\begin{construct}[Suspension]\index{suspension}
		Let $X$ be a topological space. The suspension of $X$ is defined as the following quotient space:
		\begin{equation}
			\label{topology:suspension}
			SX = 	(X\times [0, 1])/\{(x, 0) \sim (y, 0)\text{ and }(x, 1) \sim (y, 1)|x, y\in X\}
		\end{equation}
	\end{construct}
	
	\begin{construct}[Attaching space]\index{attaching space}\label{topology:attaching_space}
		Let $X, Y$ be two topological spaces and consider a subspace $A\subseteq Y$. For every continuous map $f:A\rightarrow X$, called the \textbf{attaching map}, we can construct the attaching space\footnote{Sometimes called the \textbf{adjunction space}.} $X\cup_f Y$ in the following way:
		\begin{equation}
			X\cup_f Y = (X\sqcup Y)/\{A\sim f(A)\}
		\end{equation}
	\end{construct}
    
\section{Neighbourhoods}

		A set $V\subseteq\Omega$ is a neighbourhood of a point $a\in\Omega$ if there exists an open set $U\in\tau$ such that $a\in U\subseteq V$.
	}
    
	\newdef{Basis}{\index{basis}
	    	Let $\mathcal{B}\subseteq\tau$ be a family of open sets. The family $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for the topological space $(\Omega, \tau)$ if every $U\in\tau$ can be written as:
	        \begin{equation}
	        	U = \bigcup_{V\in\mathcal{F}}V
	        \end{equation}
	        where $\mathcal{F}\subseteq\mathcal{B}$.
	}
	\newdef{Local basis}{

	}
	\begin{property}[Decreasing basis]

	\end{property}
    
	\newdef{Second-countability}{
    		A topological space $(\Omega, \tau)$ is second-countable if there exists a countable global basis.
	}
    
	\begin{property}
	    	Let $X$ be a topological space. The closure of a subset $V$ is given by:
	    	\begin{equation}
	    		\label{topology:closure}
	    		\overline{V} = \{x\in X| \exists \text{ a net } (x_\lambda)_{\lambda\in I} \text{ in } X:x_\lambda\rightarrow x\}
	    	\end{equation}
	    	This implies that the topology on $X$ is completely determined by the convergence of nets\footnote{See definition \ref{set:net}.}.
	\end{property}
	\begin{result}
	    	In first-countable spaces we only have to consider the convergence of sequences.
	\end{result}
    
	\newdef{Germ}{\index{germ}\label{topology:germ}
		Let $X$ be a topological space and let $Y$ be a set. Consider two functions $f, g: X\rightarrow Y$. If there exists a neighbourhood $U$ of a point $x\in X$ such that
		\[f(u) = g(u)\qquad\qquad\forall u\in U\]
		then this property defines an equivalence relation denoted by $f\sim_x g$ and the equivalence classes are called \textbf{germs}.
	}
	
	\begin{property}
		Let the set $Y$ in the previous definition be the set of reals $\mathbb{R}$. Then the germs at a point $p\in X$ satisfy following closure/linearity relations:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item $[f] + [g] = [f+g]$
			\item $\lambda[f] = [\lambda f]$
			\item $[f][g] = [fg]$
		\end{itemize}

	}

	\newdef{Hausdorff space}{\index{Hausdorff!space}
		A topological space is a Hausdorff space or $T_2$ space if it satisfies the following axiom:
		\begin{equation}
			(\forall x, y \in\Omega)(\exists \text{ neighbourhoods }U, V)(x\in U, y\in V, U\cap V=\emptyset)
		\end{equation}
		This axiom is called the \textbf{Hausdorff separation axiom} or $T_2$ axiom. The points are said to be separated by neighbourhoods.
	}
    	\begin{property}
		Every singleton (and thus also every finite set) is closed in a Hausdorff space.
	\end{property}
	
	\newdef{Urysohn space\footnotemark}{\index{Urysohn!space}
		\footnotetext{Sometimes called a $T_{2\nicefrac{1}{2}}$ space.}
		A topological space is an Urysohn space if every two distcinct points are separated by closed neighbourhoods.
	}

	\newdef{Regular space}{\index{regular}\label{topology:regular}
		A topological space is said to be regular if for every closed subset $F$ and every point $x\not\in F$ there exist disjoint open subsets $U, V$ such that $x\in U$ and $F\subset V$.
	}
	\newdef{$T_3$ axiom}{
		A space that is both regular and $T_0$ is $T_3$.
	}

	\newdef{Normal space}{\index{normal}\label{topology:normal}

	}
	\newdef{$T_4$ axiom}{

\section{Morphisms}
\subsection{Convergence}

	\newdef{Convergence}{\index{convergence}
	    	A sequence $(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ in $X$ is said to converge to a point $a\in X$ if:
	        \begin{equation}
	        	(\forall \text{ neighbourhoods } U \text{ of } a)(\exists N > 0)(\forall n>N)(x_n\in U)
	        \end{equation}
	}

	\begin{property}
	    	Every subsequence of a converging sequence converges to the same point\footnote{This limit does not have to be unique. See the next property for more information.}.
	\end{property}
	\begin{property}\label{topology:theorem:hausdorff_limit}

	\end{property}

\subsection{Continuity}
    
	\newdef{Continuity}{\index{continuity}
    		A function $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is continuous if the inverse image $f^{-1}(U)$ of every open set $U$ is also open.
	}
	\begin{theorem}
    		Let $X$ be a first-countable space. Consider a function $f:X\rightarrow Y$. The following statements are equivalent:
        	\begin{itemize}
        		\item $f$ is continuous
        		\item The sequence $(f(x_n))_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ converges to $f(a)\in Y$ whenever the sequence $(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ converges to $a\in X$.
	        \end{itemize}
	\end{theorem}
	\begin{result}
	   	If the space $Y$ in the previous theorem is Hausdorff then the limit $f(a)$ does not need to be known because the limit is unique (see \ref{topology:theorem:hausdorff_limit}).
	\end{result}
	\begin{remark}
    		If the space $X$ is not first-countable, we have to consider the convergence of nets \ref{set:net}.
	\end{remark}
    
	\begin{theorem}[Urysohn's lemma]\index{Urysohn!lemma}
    		A topological space X is normal\footnotemark\ if and only if every two closed disjoint subsets $A, B\subset X$ can be separated by a continuous function $f:X\rightarrow [0, 1]$ i.e.
    		\footnotetext{See definition \ref{topology:normal}.}
	    	\begin{equation}
    			\label{topology:urysohns_lemma}

There exists a continuous function $F:X\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ such that $\forall a\in A: F(a) = f(a)$. Furthermore, if the function $f$ is bounded then $F$ can be chosen to be bounded by the same number.
	\end{theorem}
	\sremark{The Tietze extension theorem is equivalent to Urysohn's lemma.}
    
\subsection{Homeomorphisms}

	}
	\newdef{Local homeomorphism}{\index{local!homeomorphism}

	}
	
	\newdef{Mapping cylinder}{\index{mapping cylinder}
		Let $f:X\rightarrow Y$ be a continuous function. The mapping cylinder $M_f$ is defined as follows:
		\begin{equation}
			M_f = \left([0, 1]\times X\bigsqcup Y\right)/\sim_f
		\end{equation}
		where the equivalence relation $\sim_f$ is generated by the relations $(0, x)\sim f(x)$. From this definition it follows that the "top" of the cylinder is homeomorphic to $X$ and the "base" is homeomorphic to $f(X)\subseteq Y$.
	}
	
	\newdef{Covering space}{\index{covering space}\label{topology:covering_space}

	}
	\begin{property}
		Every covering space is an \'etal\'e space.
	\end{property}
	\newdef{Section}{\index{section!of \'etal\'e spaces}
		A section of an \'etal\'e space $\pi:Y\rightarrow X$ over an open set $U\subseteq X$ is a continuous map $f$ such that $\pi\circ f = \mathbbm{1}_U$.

		\begin{itemize}
			\item $\mathbbm{1}_M\in\mathcal{G}$
			\item If $\phi\in\mathcal{G}$ then $\phi^{-1}\in\mathcal{G}$
			\item If $V\subset U$ is open then $\phi|_V\in\mathcal{G}$
			\item If $U=\bigcup_{i\in I}U_i$ and $\phi_i:U_i\rightarrow$ is an element of $\mathcal{G}$ for all $i\in I$ then $\phi\in\mathcal{G}$
			\item If $\phi:U\rightarrow V$ and $\psi:U'\rightarrow V'$ are elements of $\mathcal{G}$ and $V\cap U'\neq\emptyset$ then $\psi\circ\phi|_{\phi^{-1}(V\cap U')}\in\mathcal{G}$

\section{Connected spaces}
	
	\newdef{Connected space}{\index{connected}\label{topology:connected}
		A topological space $X$ is connected if it cannot be written as the disjoint union of two non-empty open sets. Equivalently, $X$ is connected if the only clopen sets are $X$ and $\emptyset$.
	}
	
	\begin{property}
		Let $X$ be a connected space. Let $f$ be a function on $X$. If $f$ is locally constant, i.e. for every $x\in X$ there exists a neighbourhood U on which $f$ is constant, then $f$ is constant on all of $X$.
	\end{property}
	
	\begin{theorem}[Intermediate value theorem]\index{intermediate value theorem}\label{topology:theorem:intermediate_value_theorem}
		Let $X$ be a connected space. Let $f:X\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ be a continuous function. If $a, b\in f(X)$ then for every $c\in ]a, b[$ we have that $c\in f(X)$.

	\newdef{Path-connected space\protect\footnotemark}{\index{arc}\index{path!connected}
		\footnotetext{A similar notion is that of \textbf{arcwise-connectedness} where the function $\varphi$ is required to be a homeomorphism.}
		Let $X$ be a topological space. If for every two points $x, y\in X$ there exists a continuous function $\varphi:[0, 1]\rightarrow X$ (i.e. a \textbf{path}) such that $\varphi(0)=x$ and $\varphi(1)=y$ then the space is said to be path-connected.
	}
	
	\begin{property}
		Every path-connected space is connected.
	\end{property}
	The converse does not hold. There exists however the following (stronger) relation:
	\begin{property}
		A connected and locally path-connected space is path-connected.
	\end{property}
	
	\begin{remark}
		The notions of connectedness and path-connectedness define equivalence relations on the space $X$. The equivalence classes are closed in $X$ and form a cover of $X$.

\section{Euclidean space}\index{Euclidean space}\index{Cartesian|seealso{Euclidean}}

    A finite-dimensional $\mathbb{R}$-vector space is called a \textbf{Euclidean space} or a \textbf{Cartesian space}.

    \begin{notation}
        When working in a Euclidean space the inner product $\langle v|w\rangle$ is often written as $v\cdot w$ or even $vw$.
    \end{notation}

    \newdef{Orientation}{\label{linalgebra:orientation}
        Let $\mathcal{B}, \mathcal{B}'$ be two ordered bases of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and let $Q$ be the transition matrix from $\mathcal{B}$ to $\mathcal{B}'$. If $\det(Q)>0$ then the bases are said to have the same orientation (or to be \textbf{consistently oriented}). If $\det(Q)<0$ then the bases are said to have an opposite orientation.
    }
    \begin{result}[Positive orientation]
        The previous definition imposes an equivalence relation on the set of bases of $\mathbb{R}^n$ such that the set of bases consists out of two equivalence classes. Take one class and call the bases in it \textbf{positively} (or \textbf{directly}) oriented. The bases in the other class are then said to be \textbf{negatively} (or \textbf{indirectly}) oriented.
    \end{result}
    \remark{It is convenient to take the standard basis $(e_1,\ldots,e_n)$ to be positively oriented.}

\section{Grassmanians}

    \newdef{Grassmannian}{\index{Grassmannian}\label{linalgebra:grassmannian}
        Let $V$ be a $K$-vector space. The set of all subspaces of dimension $k$ is called the Grassmannian $\text{Gr}(k, V)$.
    }
    \begin{property}\label{linalgebra:grassmannian_construction}
        GL$(V)$ acts transitively \ref{group:transitive} on all $k$-dimensional subspaces of $V$. From property \ref{group:transitive_action_property} it follows that the coset space GL$(V)/H_W$ for any stabilizer $H_W$ of some $W\in \text{Gr}(k, V)$ is isomorphic (as a set) to $\text{Gr}(k, V)$.
    \end{property}

    \newdef{Flag}{\index{flag}\index{signature}
        Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional vector space. A sequence of proper subspaces $V_1<\cdots<V_n$ is called a flag of $V$. The sequence $(\dim V_1, \ldots, \dim V_n)$ is called the \textbf{signature} of the flag. If for all $i$, $\dim V_i = i$, the flag is called \textbf{complete}.
    }

    \newdef{Flag variety}{\label{linalgebra:flag_manifold}
        The set of all flags of a given signature over a vector space $V$ is called the (generalized) flag variety (of that signature). If the underlying field is the field of real (or complex) numbers then the flag variety is a smooth (or complex) manifold\footnote{See chapter \ref{chapter:manifolds}.}, called the \textbf{flag manifold}.

        It should be noted that Grassmannians are a specific type of flag variaties.
    }

    \begin{property}[Parabolic subgroups]\index{Borel!subgroup}\index{parabolic subgroup}
        It can be shown that every flag variety has the structure of a homogeneous space: $Fl_{n,\underline{d}} \equiv \text{GL}(V) / P_{n, \underline{d}}$ (where $\underline{d}$ denotes the signature of the flags). These subgroups $P_{n,\underline{d}}$ are called \textbf{parabolic subgroups} (parabolic subgroups can always be obtained by taking intersections of maximal ones). The maximal parabolic subgroups are exactly those that define the Grassmannian variaties. The flag variety of all complete flags defines a the Borel subgroup $B_n$. It can be shown that every parabolic subgroup contains the Borel subgroup.
    \end{property}

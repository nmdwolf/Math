\section{Euclidean space \texorpdfstring{$\mathbb{R}^n$}\ }

    A finite-dimensional $\mathbb{R}$-vector space is called a \textbf{Euclidean space}.

    \begin{notation}
        When working in a Euclidean space the inner product $\langle v|w\rangle$ is often written as $v\cdot w$ or even $vw$.
    \end{notation}

    \newdef{Orientation}{\label{linalgebra:orientation}
        Let $\mathcal{B}, \mathcal{B}'$ be two ordered bases of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and let $Q$ be the transition matrix from $\mathcal{B}$ to $\mathcal{B}'$. If $\det(Q)>0$ then the bases are said to have the same orientation (or to be \textbf{consistently oriented}). If $\det(Q)<0$ then the bases are said to have an opposite orientation.
    }
    \begin{result}[Positive orientation]
        The previous definition imposes an equivalence relation on the set of bases of $\mathbb{R}^n$ such that the set of bases consists out of two equivalence classes. Take one class and call the bases in it \textbf{positively} (or \textbf{directly}) oriented. The bases in the other class are then said to be \textbf{negatively} (or \textbf{indirectly}) oriented.
    \end{result}
    \remark{It is convenient to take the standard basis $(e_1,\ldots,e_n)$ to be positively oriented.}

\subsection{Involutive algebras}

    \newdef{Involution}{\index{involution}
        Let $\cdot^\ast$ be an automorphism of an algebra $A$. If $(a^*)^* = a$ for all $a\in A$ then $\cdot^\ast$ is called an involution of $A$.
    }

    \newdef{Involutive algebra\footnotemark}{\index{algebra!involutive}\index{$*$-algebra|see{algebra, involutive}}
        \footnotetext{Also called a $^*$\textbf{-algebra}.}
        An involutive algebra is an associative algebra $A$ over a commutative involutive ring $(R, \overline{\phantom{z}}\ )$ together with an operator $\cdot^*:A\rightarrow A$ such that:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item $(a + b)^* = a^* + b^*$
            \item $(ab)^* = b^*a^*$
            \item $(\lambda a)^* = \overline\lambda a^*$
        \end{enumerate}
        where $\lambda\in R$.
    }

    \newdef{$C^*$-algebra}{\index{C$^*$-algebra}
        A $C^*$-algebra is an involutive Banach algebra\footnote{See definition \ref{linalgebra:banach_space}.} such that the \textbf{$C^*$-identity}
        \begin{gather}
            ||a^*a|| = ||a||\ ||a^*||
        \end{gather}
        is satisfied.
    }

    The Artin-Wedderburn theorem implies the following decomposition theorem:
    \begin{theorem}
        Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a finite-dimensional C$^*$-algebra. There exist unique integers $N, d_1, ..., d_N$ such that
        \begin{gather}
        \mathcal{C}\cong\bigoplus_{i=1}^NM_{d_i}(K).
        \end{gather}
        This implies that every C$^*$-algebra can be represented using block matrices.
    \end{theorem}

\subsection{Positive maps}

    \newdef{Positive element}{\index{positive}
        An element of a $C^*$-algebra is called positive if its spectrum is contained in $[0, +\infty[$.
    }
    \begin{property}
        Every positive element $a$ can be written as $a=b^*b$ for some element $b$. Hence every positive element is self-adjoint.
    \end{property}

    \newdef{Cuntz algebra}{\index{Cuntz algebra}
        The $n^{th}$ Cuntz algebra $\mathcal{O}_n$ is defined as the (universal) unital $C^*$-algebra generated by $n$ isometric elements $s_i$ under the additional relation
        \begin{gather}
        \sum_{i=1}^ns_i^*s_i = 1
        \end{gather}
        where 1 is the unit element.
    }

    \newdef{Positive map}{
        A morphism of $C^*$-algebras is called positive if every positive element is mapped to a positive element.
    }
    \newdef{Completely positive map}{\index{positive!completely}\label{operator:cp_map}\index{CP map|see{positive, completely}}
        \nomenclature[A_CP]{CP}{completely positive}
        A morphism of $C^*$-algebras $T:A\rightarrow B$ is called completely positive if for all $k\in\mathbb{N}$ the following map is positive:
        \begin{gather}
            \mathbbm{1}_k\otimes T:\mathbb{C}^{k\times k}\otimes A\rightarrow \mathbb{C}^{k\times k}\otimes B.
        \end{gather}
        If $T$ satisfies this condition only up to an integer $n$ then it is said to be \textbf{$n$-positive}.
    }

    \newdef{State}{\index{state}
        Let $A$ be a $C^*$-algebra. A state $\psi$ on $A$ is a positive linear functional of unit norm.
    }

    \newdef{Adjoint map}{\index{adjoint}
        Consider a continuous linear map $\phi$ defined on the Schatten class $\mathcal{I}_p$. Given a trace functional $\text{tr}$ on the $C^*$-algebra one can define the adjoint map $\phi^*$ defined on $\mathcal{I}_q$ whenever $p, q$ are H\"older conjugate. This adjoint is given by the following equation:
        \begin{gather}
            \text{tr}\Big((\phi^*(A))^*B\Big) = \text{tr}\Big(A^*\phi(B)\Big)
        \end{gather}
        where $A\in\mathcal{I}_q, B\in\mathcal{I}_p$.
    }
    \newdef{Trace-preserving map}{
        A map $\phi$ is said to be trace-preserving if it satisfies
        \begin{gather}
            \text{tr}(\phi(A)) = \text{tr}(A)
        \end{gather}
        for all trace class elements $A$. Using the above definition it is easily seen that on a unital $C^*$-algebra this is equivalent to
        \begin{gather}
            \phi^*(1) = 1.
        \end{gather}
    }

    \begin{property}
        \nomenclature[A_CPTP]{CPTP}{completely positive trace-preserving}
        A completely positive, trace preserving map $\phi$ satisfies:
        \begin{gather}
            ||\phi||_1 = 1
        \end{gather}
        where the subscript $1$ denotes the fact that this operator is defined on trace class elements.
    \end{property}

    \newdef{Positivity improving}{
        A positive map $\phi$ is said to be positivity improving if it satisfies
        \begin{gather}
            A\geq0, A\neq0\implies \phi(A)>0.
        \end{gather}
    }
    \newdef{Ergodic map}{\index{ergodic}
        A positive map $\phi$ is said to be ergodic if it satisfies
        \begin{gather}
            \forall A\geq0, A\neq0:\exists t_A>0:\exp(t_A\phi)A>0.
        \end{gather}
    }

\subsection{Representations}

    \newdef{$C^*$-algebra representation}{
        A representation of a $C^*$-algebra $\mathcal{C}$ is a unital $\ast$-morphism $\mathcal{C}\rightarrow\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})$.
    }
    \newdef{Cyclic vector}{\index{cyclic!vector}
        A cyclic vector for a $C^*$-algebra representation $\rho:\mathcal{C}\rightarrow\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})$ is a vector $\xi\in\mathcal{H}$ such that $\{\rho(c)\xi:c\in\mathcal{C}\}$ is (norm) dense in $\mathcal{H}$.
    }

    \begin{construct}[GNS\footnotemark\ construction]\index{GNS construction}\index{Gel'fand|seealso{GNS}}\label{operators:gns}
        \footnotetext{Gel'fand-Naimark-Segal}
        \nomenclature[A_GNS]{GNS}{Gel'fand-Naimark-Segal}
        Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a $C^*$-algebra. Given a state $\omega$ on $\mathcal{C}$ there exists a $C^*$-representation $\rho:\mathcal{C}\rightarrow\mathcal{B}(D)$ where $D\subset\mathcal{H}$ is a dense subspace of a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ such that the following conditions are satisfied:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item There exists a distinguished cyclic unit vector $\xi$ such that $D = \{\rho(c)\xi: c\in\mathcal{C}\}$.
            \item For all elements $c\in\mathcal{C}$ the following equality holds:
            \begin{gather}
                \omega(c) = \langle \rho(c)\xi,\xi \rangle.
            \end{gather}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{construct}

    \begin{theorem}[Gel'fand-Naimark]
        Every $C^*$-algebra is isometrically $\ast$-isomorphic to a norm closed ($C^*$-)algebra of bounded operators on a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$.
    \end{theorem}

\subsection{Gel'fand duality}\index{Gel'fand!duality}

    \newdef{Gel'fand spectrum}{\index{Gel'fand!spectrum}
        Consider a unital $C^*$-algebra $A$. Its set of characters, i.e. the algebra morphisms $A\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$, can be equipped with a compact\footnote{Locally compact if the algebra is non-unital.} Hausdorff topology (the weak-* topology \ref{hilbert:weak_star_topology}). This topological space is called the Gel'fand spectrum.
    }
    \newdef{Gel'fand representation}{
        Consider a $C^*$-algebra $A$ and let $\Phi_A$ denote its Gel'fand spectrum. The Gel'fand transformation of an element $a\in A$ is defined as the morphism $\hat{a}:\Phi_A\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$ given by the following formula:
        \begin{gather}
            \hat{a}(\lambda) = \langle\lambda,a\rangle
        \end{gather}
        where $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle$ denotes the pairing between $A$ and $\Phi_A$. By definition of the topology on the Gel'fand spectrum the functional $\hat{a}$ is continuous for all $a\in A$. The mapping $a\mapsto\hat{a}$ is called the Gel'fand representation of $A$.
    }

    \begin{theorem}[Gel'fand-Naimark]
        Let $A$ be a commutative $C^*$-algebra. The Gel'fand representation gives an isometric $\ast$-isomorphism between $A$ and the set of continuous functionals which vanish at infinity $C_0(\Phi_A)$ on its Gel'fand spectrum.
    \end{theorem}

\section{von Neumann algebras}

    \newdef{von Neumann algebra}{\index{von Neumann!algebra}
        A $*$-subalgebra of a $C^*$-algebra equal to its double commutant: $M'' = M$.
    }
    \newdef{Concrete von Neumann algebra}{
        A weakly closed unital $*$-algebra of bounded operators on some Hilbert space.
    }
    \begin{theorem}[Double Commutant theorem\footnotemark]
        \footnotetext{Often called \textbf{von Neumann's double commutant theorem}.}
        The above definitions are equivalent.
    \end{theorem}

    \newdef{Projection}{\index{projection}
        An element $p$ of a van Neumann algebra is called a projection if it satisfies
        \begin{gather}
            p = p^2 = p^*.
        \end{gather}
        Their name stems from the fact that if we view the von Neumann algebra as an algebra of bounded operators, then the projections are exactly the operators associated to an orthogonal projection.
    }
    \begin{property}
        Any von Neumann algebra is generated by its projections.
    \end{property}

    \newdef{Murray-von Neumann equivalence}{\index{equivalence!Murray-von Neumann}
        Two closed subspaces are said to be Murray-von Neumann equivalent if one is mapped isomorphically onto the other by a partial isometry. In terms of projections this means that $p\sim q$ if and only if there exists a partial isometry $u$ such that $p=uu^*$ and $q=u^*u$.
    }

    \newdef{Finite projection}{\index{projection!finite}
        The collection of projections inherits the structure of a partial order from the partial order on the corresponding subspaces. A projection $p$ is said to be finite if there exists no smaller projection $q$ that is equivalent to $p$.
    }

\subsection{Factors}

    \newdef{Factor}{\index{factor}
        Consider a von Neumann algebra $M$. A $*$-subalgebra $A$ is called a factor of $M$ if its center $Z(A)$ is given by the scalar multiples of the idenity.
    }

    \newdef{Type I factor}{
        A factor is of type I if it contains a \textit{minimal projection}.
    }
    \begin{property}[Type I$_n$ factors]
        Any type I factor is isomorphic to the algebra of all bounded operators on a Hilbert space. To indicate the dimension $n$ of this Hilbert space (which may be $\infty$) one sometimes uses the subclassification of type I$_n$ factors.
    \end{property}

    \newdef{Powers index}{\index{Powers}
        Consider a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ together with its von Neumann algebra of bounded operators $\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})$. A unital $*$-endomorphism $\alpha$ has Powers index $n\in\mathbb{N}$ if the space $\alpha(\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H}))$ is isomorphic to a type I$_n$ factor.
    }

    \newdef{Type II factor}{
        A factor is of type II if it contains nonzero \textit{finite projections} but no minimal ones. If the identity is finite then the factor is sometimes said to be of type II$_1$, otherwise it is of type II$_\infty$.
    }

    \newdef{Type III factor}{
        A factor is of type III if it does not contain any nonzero finite projections.
    }

\section{Operators on Banach \& Hilbert spaces}
\subsection{Operator topologies}\index{operator!topology}

    In this subsection all spaces will be assumed to be Banach unless stated otherwise.

    \newdef{Weak operator topology}{
        A sequence of operators $\seq{T}$ on a space $V$ converges to an operator $T$ in the weak (operator) topology (WOT) if the sequence $(T_nx)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ converges to $Tx$ weakly\footnote{This is with respect to the weak topology \ref{hilbert:weak_topology}.} for all $x$. Equivalently, it is the topology generated by the seminorms $\left\{T\rightarrow |\lambda(Tx)|: x\in V, \lambda\in V^*\right\}$.

        In the case of Hilbert spaces one can simplify th above definition using Riesz' representation theorem \ref{hilbert:riesz}. The weak operator toplogy on a Hilbert space is generated by the seminorms $\left\{T\mapsto |\langle Tx|y \rangle|: x, y\in\mathcal{H}\right\}$.
    }

    \newdef{Strong operator topology}{
        A sequence of operators $\seq{T}$ on a space $V$ converges to an operator $T$ in the strong (operator) topology (SOT) if the sequence $(T_nx)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ converges to $Tx$ for all $x$, i.e. the SOT is the topology of pointwise convergence. Equivalently, it is the topology generated by the seminorms $\left\{T\rightarrow ||Tx||:x\in V\right\}$.
    }

    \newdef{Operator norm}{\index{operator!norm}
            The operator norm of $L$ is defined as follows:
            \begin{gather}
                ||L||_{op} = \inf\big\{M\in\mathbb{C}:\forall v\in V:||Lv||_W \leq M||v||_V\big\}.
            \end{gather}
            Equivalent definitions of the operator norm are:
            \begin{gather}
                ||L||_{op} = \sup_{||x||\leq1}||L(x)|| = \sup_{||x||=1}||L(x)|| = \sup_{x\neq0}\stylefrac{||L(x)||}{||x||}.
            \end{gather}
    }

    \newdef{Norm topology\footnotemark}{
        \footnotetext{Also called the \textbf{uniform (operator) topology}.}
        A sequence of operators $\seq{T}$ on a space $V$ converges to an operator $T$ in the norm topology if the sequence $\{||T_n-T||\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ converges to 0.
    }

\subsection{Bounded operators}

    \newdef{Bounded operator}{\index{bounded!operator}\label{operator:bounded_operator}
        Let $L:V\rightarrow W$ be a linear operator between two Banach spaces. The operator is said to be bounded if it satisfies the following condition:
        \begin{gather}
            ||L||_{op}<\infty.
        \end{gather}
    }
    \begin{notation}
        \nomenclature[S_BVW]{$\mathcal{B}(V, W)$}{Space of bounded linear maps from the space $X$ to the space $Y$.}
        The space of bounded linear operators from $V$ to $W$ is denoted by $\mathcal{B}(V, W)$.
    \end{notation}
    \begin{property}
        If $V$ is a Banach space, then $\mathcal{B}(V)$ is also a Banach space.
    \end{property}

    Following property reduces the problem of continuity to that of boundedness:
    \begin{property}\label{operator:bounded_continuous}
        Let $f\in\mathcal{L}(V, W)$. The following statements are equivalent:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $f$ is bounded.
            \item $f$ is continuous at 0.
            \item $f$ is continuous on $V$.
            \item $f$ is uniformly continuous.
            \item $f$ maps bounded sets to bounded sets.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{property}

    \begin{property}
        Let $A$ be a bounded linear operator with eigenvalue $\lambda$. The eigenvalues of $A$ are bounded by its operator norm:
        \begin{gather}
            |\lambda|\leq||A||_{op}.
        \end{gather}
        Furthermore, every bounded linear operator on a Banach space has at least one eigenvalue.
    \end{property}
    \begin{property}
        Let $A$ be a bounded linear operator and let $A^\dag$ denote its adjoint\footnote{See definition \ref{linalgebra:adjoint_operator}.}. Then $A^\dag$ is also bounded and $||A||_{op} = ||A^\dag||_{op}$.
    \end{property}

    \newdef{Schatten class operator}{\index{Schatten class}
        Consider the space of bounded operators on a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$. The \textbf{Schatten p-norm} is defined as
        \begin{gather}
            ||T||_p = \text{tr}\left(\sqrt{T^\dag T}^{\ p}\right)^{1/p}.
        \end{gather}
        Operators for which this norm is finite are elements of the $p^{th}$ Schatten class $\mathcal{I}_p$.
    }
    \begin{property}
        The Schatten classes are Banach spaces with respect to the associated Schatten norms.
    \end{property}

    We now consider the two most prominent Schatten classes:
    \newdef{Trace class operator}{\index{trace}
        The space of trace class operators on a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ is defined as follows:
        \begin{gather}
            \mathcal{B}_1(\mathcal{H}) = \{S\in\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H}):\text{tr}(|S|)<\infty\}
        \end{gather}
        where the trace functional was defined in definition \ref{hilbert:trace} and $|S|:=\sqrt{S\dag S}$.
    }

    The following theorem can be seen as the analogon of Riesz' theorem for trace class operators:
    \begin{theorem}
        For every bounded linear functional $\rho$ on the space of trace class operators $\mathcal{B}_1(\mathcal{H})$ there exists a unique bounded linear operator $T\in\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})$ such that
        \begin{gather}
            \rho(S) = \text{tr}(ST)
        \end{gather}
        for all $S\in\mathcal{B}_1(\mathcal{H})$. Hence $\mathcal{B}_1(\mathcal{H})$ and $\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})$ are isometrically equivalent.
    \end{theorem}

    \newdef{Hilbert-Schmidt operator}{
        Consider the Hilbert-Schmidt norm $||\cdot||_2$ from equation \ref{linalgebra:hilbert_schmidt_norm}. An operator $T\in\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})$ is said to be a Hilbert-Schmidt operator if it satisfies
        \begin{gather}
            ||T||_2<\infty.
        \end{gather}
        This space is closed under taking adjoints.
    }

    A more general, but still well-behaved, class of operators is the space of closed operators:
    \newdef{Closed operator}{\index{closed!operator}
        A linear operator $f:V\rightarrow W$ is said to be closed if for every sequence $\seq{x}$ in $\dom(f)$ converging to a point $x\in V$ such that $f(x_n)$ converges to a point $y\in W$ one finds that $x\in\dom(f)$ and $f(x)=y$.

        Equivalently one can define a closed linear operator as a linear operator for which its graph is a closed subset in the direct sum $V\oplus W$.
    }
    \newdef{Closure}{\index{closure}\label{operator:closure}
        Let $:V\rightarrow Wf$ be a linear operator. Its closure (if it exists) is the closed linear operator $\overline{f}$ such that the graph of $\overline{f}$ is the closure of the graph of $f$ in $V\oplus W$.
    }

\subsection{Compact operators}

    \newdef{Compact operator}{\index{compact!operator}\label{banach:compact_operator}
        Let $V, W$ be Banach spaces. A linear operator $A:V\rightarrow W$ is compact if the image of any bounded set in $V$ is relatively compact\footnote{See definition \ref{topology:relatively_compact}.}.
    }

    \newadef{Compact operator}{
        Let $V, W$ be Banach spaces. A linear operator $A:V\rightarrow W$ is compact if for every bounded sequence $\seq{x}$ in $V$ the sequence $(A[x_n])_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\subset W$ has a convergent subsequence.
    }

    \begin{notation}
        \nomenclature[S_boundcompact]{$\mathcal{B}_0(X, Y)$}{Space of compact bounded oeprators between Banach spaces.}
        The space of compact bounded linear operators between Banach spaces $V, W$ is denoted by $\mathcal{B}_0(V, W)$. If $V=W$ then this is abbreviated to $\mathcal{B}_0(V)$ as usual.
    \end{notation}
    \begin{property}
        $\mathcal{B}_0(V)$ is a two-sided ideal in the (Banach) algebra $\mathcal{B}(V)$.
    \end{property}

\subsection{Fredholm operators}

    \begin{property}
        Every compact operator is bounded and hence continuous according to property \ref{operator:bounded_continuous}.
    \end{property}
    \begin{result}
        Every linear map between finite-dimensional Banach spaces is bounded.
    \end{result}

    \newdef{Calkin algebra}{\index{Calkin algebra}
        Consider the algebra $\mathcal{B}(V)$ of bounded linear operators on $V$ together with its two-sided ideal $\mathcal{B}_0(V)$ of compact operators. The quotient algebra $\mathcal{Q}(V) = \mathcal{B}(V)/\mathcal{B}_0(V)$ is called the Calkin algebra of $V$.
    }

    \newdef{Fredholm operator}{\index{Fredholm!operator}
        Let $V, W$ be Banach spaces. A Fredholm operator $F:V\rightarrow W$ is a bounded linear operator $F\in\mathcal{B}(V, W)$ for which the kernel and cokernel are finite-dimensional.
    }

    By a theorem of Atkinson one can characterize Fredholm operators using the Calkin algebra:
    \begin{property}[Atkinson]\index{Atkinson}
        An operator $F:V\rightarrow W$ is a Fredholm operator if and only if it is invertible when projected onto the Calkin algebra, i.e. there exists a bounded linear operator $G:W\rightarrow V$ and compact operators $C_1, C_2$ such that $\mathbbm{1}_V - FG = C_1$ and $\mathbbm{1}_W - GF = C_2$.
    \end{property}

    \newdef{Fredholm index}{\index{index!Fredholm}
        The index of a Fredholm operator $T$ is defined as follows:
        \begin{gather}
            \text{ind}(T) = \dim\ker(T) - \dim\text{coker}(T).
        \end{gather}
    }

\subsection{Spectrum}

    \newdef{Resolvent operator}{\index{resolvent}
        Let $A$ be a bounded linear operator on a normed space $V$. The resolvent operator of $A_\lambda$ for some $\lambda\in\mathbb{C}$ is defined as the operator $(A - \lambda\mathbbm{1}_V)^{-1}$.
    }

    \newdef{Resolvent set}{
        \nomenclature[S_zsymrho]{$\rho(A)$}{Resolvent set of a bounded linear operator $A$.}
        The resolvent set $\rho(A)$ consists of all scalars $\lambda\in\mathbb{C}$ for which the resolvent operator of A is a bounded linear operator on a dense subset of $V$. These scalars $\lambda$ are called \textbf{regular values} of $A$.
    }
    \newdef{Spectrum}{\index{spectrum}
        The set of scalars $\mu\in\mathbb{C}\setminus \rho(A)$ is called the spectrum $\sigma(A)$.
    }

    \begin{remark}
        By remark \ref{linalgebra:eigenvalue_remark} it is clear that every eigenvalue of $A$ belongs to the spectrum of $A$. The converse, however, is not true. This is remedied by introducing the following concepts:
    \end{remark}

    \newdef{Point spectrum}{
        The set of scalars $\mu\in\mathbb{C}$ for which $A - \mu\mathbbm{1}_V$ fails to be injective is called the point spectrum $\sigma_p(A)$. This set coincides with the set of eigenvalues of $A$.
    }
    \newdef{Continuous spectrum}{
        The set of scalars $\mu\in\mathbb{C}$ for which $A - \mu\mathbbm{1}_V$ is injective with dense image but fails to be surjective is called the continuous spectrum of $A$.
    }
    \newdef{Residual spectrum}{
        The set of scalars $\mu\in\mathbb{C}$ for which $A - \mu\mathbbm{1}_V$ is injective but fails to have a dense image is called the residual spectrum $\sigma(A)$.
    }

    \newdef{Essential spectrum}{\index{essential!spectrum}
        The set of scalars $\mu\in\mathbb{C}$ for which $A-\mu\mathbbm{1}_V$ is not a Fredholm operator is called the essential spectrum $\sigma_{\text{ess}}(A)$.
    }
    From Atkinson's theorem\footnote{In fact one could (equivalently) define the essential spectrum in terms of the Calkin algebra using Atkinson's theorem. Then this property would be an obvious consequence.} one can derive the following result:
    \begin{property}
        Let $A$ be a bounded linear operator and let $T$ be a compact operator. The essential spectra of $A$ and $A+T$ coincide.
    \end{property}

\section{\texorpdfstring{$C^*$-}{C-star }algebras}
\subsection{Involutive algebras}

    \newdef{Involution}{\index{involution}
        Let $\cdot^\ast$ be an automorphism of an algebra $A$. If $(a^*)^* = a$ for all $a\in A$ then $\cdot^\ast$ is called an involution of $A$.
    }

    \newdef{Involutive algebra\footnotemark}{\index{algebra!involutive}\index{$*$-algebra|see{algebra, involutive}}
        \footnotetext{Also called a $^*$\textbf{-algebra}.}
        An involutive algebra is an associative algebra $A$ over a commutative involutive ring $(R, \overline{\phantom{z}}\ )$ together with an operator $\cdot^*:A\rightarrow A$ such that:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $(a + b)^* = a^* + b^*$
            \item $(ab)^* = b^*a^*$
            \item $(\lambda a)^* = \overline\lambda a^*$

    }

    \newdef{$C^*$-algebra}{\index{C$^*$-algebra}
        A $C^*$-algebra is an involutive Banach algebra\footnote{See definition \ref{linalgebra:banach_space}.} such that the \textbf{$C^*$-identity}
        \begin{gather}
            ||a^*a|| = ||a||\ ||a^*||
        \end{gather}
        is satisfied.
    }

    The Artin-Wedderburn theorem implies the following decomposition theorem:
    \begin{theorem}
        Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a finite-dimensional C$^*$-algebra. There exist unique integers $N, d_1, ..., d_N$ such that
        \begin{gather}
        \mathcal{C}\cong\bigoplus_{i=1}^NM_{d_i}(K).
        \end{gather}

\subsection{Positive maps}

    \newdef{Positive element}{\index{positive}
        An element of a $C^*$-algebra is called positive if its spectrum is contained in $[0, +\infty[$.

    \begin{property}
        Every positive element $a$ can be written as $a=b^*b$ for some element $b$. Hence every positive element is self-adjoint.

    \newdef{Cuntz algebra}{\index{Cuntz algebra}
        The $n^{th}$ Cuntz algebra $\mathcal{O}_n$ is defined as the (universal) unital $C^*$-algebra generated by $n$ isometric elements $s_i$ under the additional relation
        \begin{gather}
        \sum_{i=1}^ns_i^*s_i = 1
        \end{gather}
        where 1 is the unit element.

    \newdef{Positive map}{

    }
    \newdef{Completely positive map}{\index{positive!completely}\label{operator:cp_map}\index{CP map|see{positive, completely}}
        \nomenclature[A_CP]{CP}{completely positive}
        A morphism of $C^*$-algebras $T:A\rightarrow B$ is called completely positive if for all $k\in\mathbb{N}$ the following map is positive:
        \begin{gather}
            \mathbbm{1}_k\otimes T:\mathbb{C}^{k\times k}\otimes A\rightarrow \mathbb{C}^{k\times k}\otimes B.
        \end{gather}

        Consider a continuous linear map $\phi$ defined on the Schatten class $\mathcal{I}_p$. Given a trace functional $\text{tr}$ on the $C^*$-algebra one can define the adjoint map $\phi^*$ defined on $\mathcal{I}_q$ whenever $p, q$ are \textit{H\"older conjugate}. This adjoint is given by the following equation:
        \begin{gather}
            \text{tr}\Big((\phi^*(A))^*B\Big) = \text{tr}\Big(A^*\phi(B)\Big)

        \end{gather}

        Any type I factor is isomorphic to the algebra of all bounded operators on a Hilbert space. To indicate the dimension $n$ of this Hilbert space (which may be $\infty$) one sometimes uses the subclassification of type I$_n$ factors.
    \end{property}

    \newdef{Powers index}{\index{Powers}
        Consider a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ together with its von Neumann algebra of bounded operators $\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})$. A unital $*$-endomorphism $\alpha$ has Powers index $n\in\mathbb{N}$ if the space $\alpha(\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H}))$ is isomorphic to a type I$_n$ factor.

    \newdef{Type II factor}{
        A factor is of type II if it contains a nonzero \textit{finite projection} (but no minimal ones).

    \newdef{Type III factor}{
        A factor is of type III if it does not contain any nonzero finite projections.
